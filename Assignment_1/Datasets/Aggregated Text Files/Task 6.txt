ABSTRACT: With the advancement of technology and widespread use of the internet, the concept of big data, which we often hear about, has emerged. Transforming big data, briefly defined as a stack of unstructured data, into meaningful information and revealing hidden patterns can be achieved by different methods. The use of this group of methods and algorithms, called data mining, with artificial intelligence and statistics, enables more understandable, meaningful and effective decisions to be made. This helps to optimize profits by reducing costs and increasing performance. In this study; By Borusan Cat, Caterpillar Inc. Using oil analysis data obtained from construction machines, a model has been developed that will enable early malfunction detection of machines and identification of vehicle maintenance needs. With the developed system, the oil analysis data of the vehicles are used to predict the number of working hours in which the vehicle will break down, using machine learning methods, in advance. Then, forecast data is integrated into decision mechanisms in business processes, and finally, the information obtained is reported using data visualization technologies and made traceable through summary data. The system developed in this personalized product-focused study, which is the subject of Industry 4.0, can be easily adapted to the operation of different machines. In this way, it will be easier to track and control the vehicles, and it will be possible to detect any malfunctions that may occur in the vehicles without stopping the flow of the process. By contributing to the extension of the life of the machines used with the proposed approach, eliminating the costs of purchasing a new machine, which can be quite costly, or purchasing repairs and spare parts due to possible damage, will provide significant returns to companies in terms of cost and time. Another important contribution of the system will undoubtedly be environmental sustainability. © 2024, Collegium Basilea. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: For over 60 years, spinal cord stimulation has endured as a therapy through innovation and novel developments. Current practice of neuromodulation requires proper patient selection, risk mitigation and use of innovation. However, there are tangible and intangible challenges in physiology, clinical science and within society. Areas covered: We provide a narrative discussion regarding novel topics in the field especially over the last decade. We highlight the challenges in the patient care setting including selection, as well as economic and socioeconomic challenges. Physician training challenges in neuromodulation is explored as well as other factors related to the use of neuromodulation such as novel indications and economics. We also discuss the concepts of technology and healthcare data. Expert opinion: Patient safety and durable outcomes are the mainstay goal for neuromodulation. Substantial work is needed to assimilate data for larger and more relevant studies reflecting a population. Big data and global interconnectivity efforts provide substantial opportunity to reinvent our scientific approach, data analysis and its management to maximize outcomes and minimize risk. As improvements in data analysis become the standard of innovation and physician training meets demand, we expect to see an expansion of novel indications and its use in broader cohorts. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The ultimate goal of value-based laboratory medicine is maximizing the effectiveness of laboratory tests in improving patient outcomes, optimizing resources and minimizing unnecessary costs. This approach abandons the oversimplified notion of test volume and cost, in favor of emphasizing the clinical utility and quality of diagnostic tests in the clinical decision-making. Several key elements characterize value-based laboratory medicine, which can be summarized in some basic concepts, such as organization of in vitro diagnostics (including appropriateness, integrated diagnostics, networking, remote patient monitoring, disruptive innovations), translation of laboratory data into clinical information and measurable outcomes, sustainability, reimbursement, ethics (e.g., patient empowerment and safety, data protection, analysis of big data, scientific publishing). Education and training are also crucial, along with considerations for the future of the profession, which will be largely influenced by advances in automation, information technology, artificial intelligence, and regulations concerning in vitro diagnostics. This collective opinion paper, composed of summaries from presentations given at the two-day European Federation of Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) Strategic Conference "A vision to the future: value-based laboratory medicine"(Padova, Italy; September 23-24, 2024), aims to provide a comprehensive overview of value-based laboratory medicine, projecting the profession into a more clinically effective and sustainable future.  © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2024.

ABSTRACT: Farms face an increasing administrative burden due to the push for a more sustainable agri-food system. Farms are required to demonstrate compliance with various sustainability schemes, and this trend is expected to intensify with a more performance-based CAP and new directives and regulations. The need for smart data reporting is emphasised, with a focus on minimising the administrative burden, creating useful systems and indicators for farm management, and ensuring auditability. We advocate smart reporting as a solution and innovation in the farm office. The integration of data from Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) with sustainability indicators is proposed in order to streamline the reporting process. The importance of using technology, such as e-invoicing and robotic accounting, is highlighted to monitor and report crucial performance data. The integration of FMIS and Farm Financial Accounting (FFA) is proposed as a solution to enhance auditability and reduce manual input. The potential benefits of fully digital invoices and delivery notes to further streamline data exchange are proposed. Additionally, the paper discusses the role of central databases in the dairy sector. Policy implications for governments in promoting data-intensive relationships with farmers are identified. They build upon previous policy measures that involved accounting within farms and the digital exchange of data. The paper concludes by emphasising the importance of supporting innovation in the farm office to unlock the full potential of technologies like blockchain, big data analysis, artificial intelligence and sustainability management. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Livestock management is evolving into a new era, characterized by the analysis of vast quantities of data (Big Data) collected from both traditional breeding methods and new technologies such as sensors, automated monitoring system, and advanced analytics. Artificial intelligence (A-In), which refers to the capability of machines to mimic human intelligence, including subfields like machine learning and deep learning, is playing a pivotal role in this transformation. A wide array of A-In techniques, successfully employed in various industrial and scientific contexts, are now being integrated into mainstream livestock management practices. In the case of swine breeding, while traditional methods have yielded considerable success, the increasing amount of information requires the adoption of new technologies such as A-In to drive productivity, enhance animal welfare, and reduce environmental impact. Current findings suggest that these techniques have the potential to match or exceed the performance of traditional methods, often being more scalable in terms of efficiency and sustainability within the breeding industry. This review provides insights into the application of A-In in porcine breeding, from the perspectives of both sows (including welfare and reproductive management) and boars (including semen quality and health), and explores new approaches which are already being applied in other species. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The training of hospital pharmacists in the coming years must adapt and respond to constant current and future social and technological challenges, without neglecting the basic areas of the profession. It is necessary to acquire knowledge in what is known as digital comprehensive health: artificial intelligence, technology and automation, digital skills, and new forms of communication with patients, such as telemedicine and telepharmacy that are already a reality in many hospitals. We must provide knowledge in automated systems for the distribution and dispensing of medicines, robots for preparing sterile preparations, traceability systems, the use of drones in clinical care, etc. as well as training in the application of technology in pharmaceutical care, through devices and applications that help identify patients who require specific care early and effectively. In this digital scenario, new risks and challenges must be faced, such as cybersecurity and cyber resilience, which makes the training and education of healthcare professionals in general, and hospital pharmacists in particular, inexcusable. On the other hand, the appearance of increasingly complex and innovative therapies has a great impact not only on health population but also on economic and environmental issues, which makes new competencies and skills essential to develop and implement disruptive and competent financing, equity, and sustainability strategies. In this demanding and hyper-connected environment, it is understandable that the well-known “burned out worker syndrome” appears, which prevents the correct personal and professional development of the team and highlights the importance of quality training for its prevention and management. In short, in the next decade, the training of hospital pharmacists must be aimed at providing knowledge in innovation and in basic skills needed to adapt and succeed to current demands and changes. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The main purpose of examining innovation development (ID), technology management (TM) and big data analytics capability (BDAC) from the perspective of information technology companies is to help these companies optimize their business strategies and increase their competitiveness. When these concepts are considered together, it is aimed to present suggestions that information technology companies can increase their innovation capacities, optimize their technology portfolios and develop their big data analytics capacities. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from information technology companies working on big data analytics in technoparks in Istanbul. In the research, the Marmara region of Turkey was preferred because it is the region where the information technology sector is most common. In total, 503 questionnaires were collected. SmartPLS (4.0.8.4) licensed software was used in the research, and the results are presented with tables and figures. Findings: As a result of the analysis of the data, it is supported by hypotheses that ID and TM have positive effects as independent variables and BDAC has positive effects as both independent and mediation variables. Research limitations/implications: In terms of the limitations of the research, since the data were collected only from the information technology companies in the technoparks in Istanbul, it would not be correct to generalize the analysis results. For this reason, it is recommended to develop a research model and contribute to the literature by considering this limited situation for similar studies to be conducted in the future. Practical implications: By focusing on ID, it is important for companies to analyze their innovation processes and increase their ID capacity. On the subject of TM, analyses help companies identify their current technological infrastructure and development needs and optimize their technology portfolios. Big data analytics is an important tool that companies can use in their decision-making processes. Therefore, analyses of big data analytics can evaluate companies' current data analytics capacities and offer improvement suggestions. Originality/value: So why are ID, TM and BDAC important? Why should a research model be developed to examine the effects of these variables? This situation can be understood by looking at the investments made by two world-class companies with headquarters in Istanbul/Turkey. L'Oréal Turkey integrates big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital platforms into its business processes by investing in new technologies and also makes a difference with innovation in environmental sustainability and social responsibility. PepsiCo, on the other hand, placed a great emphasis on innovation by opening its third Design and Innovation Center in Turkey and Europe in Istanbul. For this reason, examining the effects of ID, TM and big data analytics together in the research is important for the originality of the research. Examining these variables by focusing on their interactions and effects increases the originality of the subject. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This research evaluates the effect the industrial revolution era 4.0 has had on the performance and sustainability of coffee farmer cooperatives, especially in the West Java region, considering that West Java is a coffee center area that is starting to be taken into account in Indonesia and the world in general, this is evidenced by the increasing number of farmer cooperatives coffee in the West Java region. One of the most monumental effects of the industrial revolution 1.0 was the birth of the British cooperative in Rochdale, the world’s first modern cooperative. The industry continues to develop, cooperatives continue to adapt and try to continue to develop in accordance with technological advances, especially now that the industrial revolution 4.0 has entered, which emphasizes information technology, especially the use of the internet. However, there has been no previous research examining the use of information technology in coffee farmer cooperatives, especially in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, even though this information technology is very important in the development of cooperatives today. Quantitative descriptive method with SEM analysis was used to identify the effect of cooperative capability on the performance and sustainability of cooperatives in several coffee cooperatives in West Java. The study’s results found that the power of the cooperative did not significantly affect the performance of the Coffee Cooperative. Still, the capability of the cooperative had a positive and significant effect on the sustainability of the Coffee Cooperative. At the same time, the performance of the cooperative had a positive and significant impact on the sustainability of the coffee cooperative. The ability of cooperatives has a positive and significant effect on sustainability mediated by the performance of the Coffee Cooperative in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era. This study recommends increasing the capabilities of cooperatives in membership, management, and business models to become sustainable cooperatives based on information technology to achieve added value from market-driven coffee products. The results of the study show that the respondents perceive that the cooperative’s performance has a positive effect on their sustainability. Improving the performance of cooperatives in terms of (1) productivity, (2) effectiveness, (3) quality, and (4) achievement can be regarded as having a direct impact on the Coffee Cooperative’s long-term viability. The industrial revolution in the agricultural sector is facing demographic challenges (ageing), so intelligent technology, artificial intelligence, big data, and augmented reality are strategic choices. The application of information technology has a direct or indirect positive impact on Indonesia’s agricultural sector. Cooperatives in coffee agribusiness is also increasingly needed to respond to market demand by applying Information and Communication Technology (ICT). © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Big data processing, vast computing power, information technology, improved machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are driving the recent growth in AI technologies. With more conventional methods, Google would not have been able to reduce its field device management costs by 40% as much as it has by deploying deep-mind AI technologies. The energy sector can benefit from AI technology by utilizing the expanding opportunities that result from the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. Supercomputers, power electronics, cyber technologies, information, and bi-directional connectivity between the control center and equipment are only a few of the sophisticated infrastructures available to the smart energy sector. The infrastructures of the current electricity system are too old, ineffective, outdated, unreliable, and do not offer enough protection from fault circumstances. But energy production, distribution strategy, and financial sustainability are crucial for the world economy. The integration of renewable energy sources was not intended to be managed by the conventional power system (RES). Meeting the fluctuating demands of the power system is made more difficult by changes in the characteristics of RES (such as wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrogen). The energy sector is undergoing a change thanks to recent developments in AI technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, IoT, big data, etc. Many nations have implemented AI technology to carry out many types of jobs, including managing, predicting, and effective power system operations. Photovoltaic (PV) systems may be controlled effectively by inverters thanks to, which also improves the ability to track power points. Artificial maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are efficient and can improve performance compared to conventional MPPT techniques. Due of its simplicity and speed of calculation, particle swarm optimization for MPPT is preferred by swarm intelligence classes Predictive technologies are frequently used to anticipate load demand, electricity costs, generation from RES (such as wind, hydro, solar, and geothermal energy), as well as fossil fuels (such as oil, natural gas, and coal). Probabilistic forecasting (forecasting future events, for example) and non-probabilistic forecasting (forecasting fuel purchase management, generation planning, distribution scheduling, various forms of investment programs, maintenance schedules, and security purposes) are both possible. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Facing the challenges of globalisation and unpredictable shocks, manufacturers seek novel methods to maintain the sustainability of their supply chains. Adopting Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies facilitates sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with the precise decision-making of supply chain activities and the realisation of circular development. However, according to the bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of articles related to “SSCM”, few frameworks with I4.0 technologies are found to empower SSCM under circular economy (CE) logic. Thus, this article proposes a conceptual framework of I4.0 technologies-embedded SSCM, which takes advantage of five kinds of emerging digital technologies, including cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), blockchain technology (BT), and internet of things (IoT). The CAB2IN framework is based on the technologies mentioned above alongside the design, manufacturing, delivering, using, and end-of-life stages of products and services to meet the requirements of reducing material usage, remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This paper's contribution lies in indicating the trends of SSCM in the era of Industry 4.0 and proposing CAB2IN to creatively establish the virtual side of circular SSCM, which leverages the data generated in each stage to assist sustainable decision-making. CAB2IN illuminates several research directions for future studies of digitalised SSCM under the perspective of CE. The case of Company S illustrates the application of CAB2IN in the healthcare supply chain. This paper also summarises insightful directions of digitalised SSCM under the proposed circular framework. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Green knowledge management (GKM) has become a more prominent research topic because of its ability to balance business sustainability, performance and society's well-being. The purpose of this paper is to study how GKM literature evolved before and after two major events: the introduction of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the first conceptualization of GKM. In this paper, GKM is holistically examined following the stages of the knowledge management cycle, a framework for organizational knowledge-processing phases. Design/methodology/approach: This study performed a bibliometric analysis of 1,274 papers related to GKM from 1995 until January 2024. Findings: Over the three decades, this research outlined the intertwined relationships between core themes in the domain such as knowledge management in the context of corporate social responsibilities, sustainable development (SD), competitive advantage and so on, and popular theories. GKM evolved from an “industrial and technical view” of knowledge management to a more emerging perspective of a “social process.” Emerging themes were identified such as green innovation, information security or organizational learning sub-themes with key technologies like block-chain, big data analytics and artificial intelligence. Future research can explore themes such as green knowledge integration, green entrepreneurship, green supply chain and green knowledge integration capabilities.

ABSTRACT: The current socio-economic and environmental context obliges companies to increase their energy efficiency to be competitive, and the development of Industry 4.0 technologies should contribute to improve it. This article analyses the influence of Industry 4.0 technologies on energy efficiency and the mediation of quality management of production process variables. After a descriptive analysis, a correlation and regression analysis is presented using information from 72 projects for the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in industrial companies. At a global level, it is confirmed that the four technology groups (Artificial Vision and Artificial Intelligence, Additive Manufacturing and Robotics, Big Data and Advanced Analytics, and Internet of Things) contribute to improving energy efficiency by an average of 15–25% in the processes where they are integrated. In addition, the regression model determines that improved decision-making capabilities strongly mediate the achievement of higher energy efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Global urbanization is growing at a rapid pace and in the near future most of the world’s population will move to cities. This trend will be extremely challenging for: land use management, sustainable urban development, food supply, security and general human well-being. Thus, for several years, emerging technologies and new concepts of smart cities have been proposed to ensure optimal management of the cities of the future, namely artificial intelligence applications such as: The Internet of Things (IoT), the Machine Learning (ML) and the Deep Learning (DL). In this context, we propose in this paper a methodology that is based on the use of the Formal Concept Analyzes (FCA) method on some qualitative data points obtained from the City Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) database to generate some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can help and guide decision makers to reduce CO 2 emissions and build as well efficient sustainable development strategies, especially for the cities of the future. We have focused our experimentation on 9 American cities. Our experimental results show that New York is the city that emits the most CO 2 and that the emission sources are: transportation, urban land Use and Energy Demand in Buildings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: During the pandemic, US museums had to cope with stringency and lockdown. The impact of the pandemic was very different in the US states as for timing and policies, and the cultural and creative industries were tremendously affected. The sustainability of museums was granted by their digitization as for contents, communication, social media marketing, and fundraising. Digitization became a crucial factor in the development of activities inside and outside museums. Information Technology (IT) was accentuated, and the effort was reinforced to adapt and advance offline collections and exhibitions to virtual audiences, whose profiling can today better framed thanks to big data and artificial intelligence. Accounting of expenses and revenues changed, as well as the approach to bidirectional and social media networking and engagement. Considering a very deep analysis of the academic literature about digitization in museums, the aim of the paper is the regression of accounting data of 2020s 990 Forms for revenues (contributions and program service), advertising expense, fundraising, and IT ones, so that, thanks a stepwise, multiple, and linear regression, it can be detected how much communication efforts and concerning expenses impacted on revenues in such an extraordinary contingency. Results provide evidence of the highest and positive correlation between contributions and IT expense as well as program service revenues. With the approach of behavioral economics, the focus on some case histories will disclose how much the digitization changed relationships with visitors thanks to edutainment and social media. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: A smart city is a concept that leverages technology to improve the quality of life for citizens, enhance sustainability, and streamline urban services. The goal of a smart city is to use data and technology to manage resources and assets efficiently, make informed decisions, and create a more livable and thriving city for its residents. Smart cities rely on a range of technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and cloud computing to gather, process, and analyze data from various sources. The aim is to create a city that is more connected, responsive, and sustainable, and that provides its residents with a better quality of life, opportunities, and services. A secure and efficient message communication protocol for sensitive information and real-time communication is critical for the functioning of a smart city environment. The main findings of this paper are to develop a new authentication protocol that meets the specific requirements and constraints of smart city applications. The message communication between smart cities is conducted with the help of a gateway. The challenge in constructing a working, viable infrastructure for a smart city is to provide secure authentication for message communication between the user and gateway node in one network, and the gateway node of one network to the gateway node of the other network. The objective for doing research to develop an authentication protocol that ensures the privacy and security of data transmitted in smart city applications while maintaining a lightweight and efficient design. This paper proposes a secure authentication protocol and key establishment scheme for access to the application in smart cities to make feasible access through the IoT environment. The proposed protocol ensures the mutual authentication between user and gateways, and the security analysis shows that the proposed protocol is effective against energy consumption and have less computational cost. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed and tested using BAN Logic and AVISPA security verification to confirm the authenticity of the security protocol. We do compare with past studies of which our proposed method outperformed. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The advancements of the 1980s led to the creation of various important technologies, including GPS and satellite imagery, which allowed for the sustainable management of land resources. This must be done while preserving sustainable landuse systems and confronting concerns such as climate change, water scarcity, and the risk of increasing erosion and productivity due to extreme weather events. In several areas, geospatial Big Data analytics is transforming the way firms’ function. Although there are many research workson geographic data analytics and real-time data processing of massive spatial data streams in the literature, only a few have covered the entire geospatial big data analytics and geospatial data science project lifecycle. Because of the volume, pace, and variety of the data being analysed, big data analysis differs from typical data analysis. In comparison to conventional data analysis projects, geospatial data science initiatives are likely to be more difficult and require advanced technologies. The current study introduces a novel geographic big data mining and machine learning framework for geospatial data gathering, fusion, storage, management, processing, analysis, visualisation, and land resource modelling and evaluation. Any data science project that has a robust procedure for land resource data analysis and clear instructions for comprehensive analysis is always a positive. It also aids in estimating the amount of time and resources required early in the process to gain a good picture of the land resource challenges that must be overcome. Automation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), drones, satellite imagers, and Big Data lay the foundation for a global “Digital Twin,” which will aid in the development of site-specific conservation and management practices that will boost incomes and ensure the long-term sustainability of land use/land cover systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: The proliferation of information technology as a dominant industry has successfully dictated the industrial revolution in the past couple of decades. What was measured using consumption of sulphuric acid in the second half of the last century has now shifted towards development of sustainable information technologies. The growth is not only accompanied with real-life bargains of smart cities and coasters of earthly pleasures but also the wrath of information and communication technology (ICT) waste. ICT waste, what is commonly known as electronic waste (e-waste), is a humongous problem worldwide. The fourth industrial revolution, otherwise known as ‘Industry 4.0,' is the latest paradigm shift happening, which is largely facilitated by new information technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, edge computing, Big Data analytics, blockchain technologies, etc. Although there is a lot of software, artificial intelligence, and coding involved, these technologies are also pallbearers of future ICT waste as they cannot function or communicate without communication hardware devices. The aforementioned technologies can be particularly helpful in managing ICT waste. Reported literature depicts that there are existing examples that utilize these technologies towards managing ICT waste. As the whole world is gearing up towards a ‘sustainable development’ era with cleaner production lines replicating a greener Utopian future, it is imperative to look into the depths of these technologies. In this light, we present a detailed review of the new and upcoming information technologies with an aim to project their potential application in ICT waste management. The study will also focus on the sustainability aspects of the possible outcomes. The chapter will be helpful to lay a foundation knowledge base for researchers and other stakeholders. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Biswajit Debnath, Abhijit Das, Potluri Anil Chowdary, and Siddhartha Bhattacharyya; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: Highlights: What are the main findings? Ensemble learning methods proved superior in accurately predicting the depth of bearing layers critical to urban infrastructure, improving geotechnical predictions and urban planning. The integration of smart technologies and predictive analytics significantly improved the accuracy of geotechnical investigations, facilitating the development of smart cities by providing advanced tools for real-time data analysis and geographic mapping. What are the implications of the main finding? The success of ensemble learning in accurately predicting the depth of bearing layers can lead to more reliable urban planning and infrastructure development, reducing the risks associated with building on unstable ground. By using advanced predictive analytics, smart city technologies can significantly improve the resilience and sustainability of urban environments, leading to better preparedness for environmental challenges and disasters. This paper addresses challenges and solutions in urban development and infrastructure resilience, particularly in the context of Japan’s rapidly urbanizing landscape. It explores the integration of smart city concepts to combat land subsidence and liquefaction, phenomena highlighted by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Additionally, it examines the current situation and lack of geoinformation and communication technology in the concept of smart cities in Japan. Consequently, this study employs advanced technologies, including smart sensing and predictive analytics through kriging and ensemble learning, with the objective of enhancing the precision of geotechnical investigations and urban planning. By analyzing data in Setagaya, Tokyo, it develops predictive models to accurately determine the depth of bearing layers that are critical to urban infrastructure. The results demonstrate the superiority of ensemble learning in predicting the depth of bearing layers. Two methods have been developed to predict undetected geographic data and prepare ground reality and digital smart maps for the construction industry to build smart cities. This study is useful for real-time analysis of existing data, for the government to make new urban plans, for construction companies to conduct risk assessments before doing their jobs, and for individuals to obtain real-time geographic data and hazard warnings through mobile phones and other means in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of predictive analysis of geographic information being conducted through geographic information, big data technology, machine learning, integrated learning, and artificial intelligence. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Cities serve as pivotal symbols of human civilization, and evaluating their development and decline is crucial for urban planning, construction, and governance. Such evaluations carry substantial implications for local government performance assessments, corporate investments, and residents' settlements. However, current research on city evaluation faces several challenges, including ambiguous evaluation purposes and target audiences, a lack of a solid theoretical or practical foundation for index systems, high redundancy in indices, poor comparability, disregard for urban diversity, an excessive focus on city rankings, and a dearth of result validation and feedback mechanisms. There is also a shortage of systematic interpretation regarding the composition, principles, paradigms, process, and uncertainties associated with urban evaluation systems. In this paper, we commence by scrutinizing the structural interconnections and evolution of urban systems through the lens of complex systems and living organisms. Subsequently, we elucidate the fundamental concepts, components, and functions of city evaluation, categorize the key paradigms, and propose four basic principles: people- centric, emergence, balance, and feedback- driven. We posit that the city evaluation system comprises five essential elements: the evaluating subject, the evaluated object, the index framework, evaluation methods, and the evaluation findings. We provide a comprehensive exploration of the general quantitative city evaluation process, encompassing ten distinct phases. These phases include clarifying the subject/object and the evaluation goals, establishing the theoretical underpinning and logical framework, outlining the criteria for indicator selection, establishing the evaluation index system, ensuring the consistency and dimensionless of the indicators, determining the weightings and thresholds of the indicators, selecting or constructing the evaluation model, analyzing and validating the evaluation outcomes, displaying and applying the results, and overseeing and incorporating feedback into the evaluation. The uncertainty and limitations of city evaluation are sorted from the aspects of cognition, data, indicators, methods, and systems. Furthermore, we envision the future of city evaluation for sustainable development, emphasizing the need to assemble a diverse group of evaluation stakeholders, develop a unified and shared foundational information platform, create a city space- time knowledge map, harness emerging technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and digital twinning, promote "dynamic perception, multi- evaluation collaboration" and forge a future city that embodies inclusivity, safety, fairness, environmental sustainability, and resilience. © 2024 Science Press.

ABSTRACT: Today’s industry is undergoing rapid transformation because of the rapidly growing digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions. With this transformation, developments in intelligent automation, for example, the digitalizing world, robotic systems, information technology, big data, and artificial intelligence, which create new problems that businesses will face, affect human resources management applications and processes. This makes it necessary to develop capabilities that can fight with all competitors in the world whose borders are removed thanks to the internet to gain competitive advantage. Simple and routine processes are becoming increasingly automated, while nonsimple processes are becoming more complex. Therefore, both competencies of the existing workforce should be increased, and the enterprises should gain competitive advantage to survive in the long term. For this reason, the development of human resources strategies that will support the general strategy of the enterprises emerges as a strategic necessity. At this point, in the age of AI starting with Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0, it is of great importance how to ensure sustainable human resources management and how human resources departments and policies will be affected by these changes. In addition, with the technological developments experienced, it is based on a human- and environment-oriented approach for social, environmental, and economic sustainability to better meet industrial and technological targets without compromising socioeconomic conditions and environmental performance. Therefore, establishing smart and environmentally friendly organizations comes to the forefront. Additionally, with Industry 4.0 and the ensuing Industry 5.0, which is defined as the next stage of creating sustainable industrial value, it is now seen that there is a need for sustainable development and to consider the vital role of humans in the assumptions of future development of the industry. Therefore, with technological changes brought in by the industrial revolutions for the enterprises, the difficulties faced by the enterprises in both production and human resources management, such as large datasets and the need for quick decision making, arises. In this regard, businesses have to develop new strategies that focus on industrial sustainability and meeting social, economic, and environmental needs in the current age of AI. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vikas Garg, Richa Goel, Pooja Tiwari, and Esra S.

ABSTRACT: Big data processing, vast computing power, information technology, improved machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are driving the recent growth in AI technologies. With more conventional methods, Google would not have been able to reduce its field device management costs by 40% as much as it has by deploying deep-mind AI technologies. The energy sector can benefit from AI technology by utilizing the expanding opportunities that result from the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. Supercomputers, power electronics, cyber technologies, information, and bi-directional connectivity between the control center and equipment are only a few of the sophisticated infrastructures available to the smart energy sector. The infrastructures of the current electricity system are too old, ineffective, outdated, unreliable, and do not offer enough protection from fault circumstances. But energy production, distribution strategy, and financial sustainability are crucial for the world economy. The integration of renewable energy sources was not intended to be managed by the conventional power system (RES). Meeting the fluctuating demands of the power system is made more difficult by changes in the characteristics of RES (such as wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrogen). The energy sector is undergoing a change thanks to recent developments in AI technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, IoT, big data, etc. Many nations have implemented AI technology to carry out many types of jobs, including managing, predicting, and effective power system operations. Photovoltaic (PV) systems may be controlled effectively by inverters thanks to, which also improves the ability to track power points. Artificial maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are efficient and can improve performance compared to conventional MPPT techniques. Due of its simplicity and speed of calculation, particle swarm optimization for MPPT is preferred by swarm intelligence classes Predictive technologies are frequently used to anticipate load demand, electricity costs, generation from RES (such as wind, hydro, solar, and geothermal energy), as well as fossil fuels (such as oil, natural gas, and coal). Probabilistic forecasting (forecasting future events, for example) and non-probabilistic forecasting (forecasting fuel purchase management, generation planning, distribution scheduling, various forms of investment programs, maintenance schedules, and security purposes) are both possible. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data to natural resource management (NRM) is revolutionizing how natural resources are managed. To gain more insights into the domain, we use 394 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the thematic evolution and explore future research directions. We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While “Remote Sensing” is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords “sustainable development” and “remote sensing” have been growing steadily since 1975, “natural resource modeling” and “machine learning” have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use. These advancements benefit society by increasing access to essential resources in a fair manner, and they have positive impacts on both the public and private sectors, enabling evidence-based policymaking and responsible resource extraction. Collaboration and investment in these technologies are crucial for achieving sustainable development and preserving natural resources for future generations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Nowadays, cities have emerged as one of the core elements for the sustainable development of human society. This also aligns well with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on sustainable cities. The pivotal role of cities is also demonstrated by the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technologies. There have been more and more studies dedicated to the realm of data-driven urban sustainability, in which the complex processes of urban sustainable development, encompassing social, economic, and ecological dimensions, are monitored, interpreted, and evaluated through massive urban data from multiple sources. However, a common limitation is that most existing studies concentrate on individual application scenarios and singular data sources and ignore the intricate interconnections among diverse urban data sources and multiple urban elements, making it challenging to explore findings across diverse urban sustainability contexts. Therefore, to address this critical gap, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for urban sustainable development driven by Urban Business Area/Region Knowledge Graph (UKG). This approach incudes two fundamental steps: the construction of a comprehensive ontology for the UKG based on massive multi-source urban data, and the subsequent synthesis of knowledge guided by this ontology to create the UKG. The construction of the UKG ontology captures important elements in cities as well as their complex interconnections, e.g., people, locations, and organizations, and their relationships in terms of spatiality, function, and association. This ontological architecture lays the foundation for the subsequent knowledge fusion, ultimately leading to the construction of UKG. The practical applications of UKG in driving urban sustainability are manifold, ranging from real-time status monitoring and nuanced interpretation of urban phenomena to the holistic evaluation of decisions made for urban sustainability. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, the paper introduces a novel cross-modality contrastive learning framework that incorporates semantic knowledge for urban sustainability. The proposed framework includes a semantic encoder and a visual encoder to capture information from UKG and urban images (satellite images and street view images), respectively. Based on the assumption that the semantic representation of UKG entities should be close to their corresponding image representations, the proposed framework successfully incorporate semantic knowledge into visual encoder, which further enhances the predictive capabilities of urban socioeconomic indicators derived from urban images. Through empirical validation, this study demonstrates the real- world applicability and generalizability of the UKG framework for urban sustainability. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

ABSTRACT: Sustainable, smart connected cars (SSCCs) are one of the representative sustainable products that leverage smart technologies (e.g., the internet of things, artificial intelligence, big data). Although many studies have investigated consumers’ purchase decisions regarding sustainable products, little research has addressed SSCCs and the relationship between privacy, disclosure intentions, and purchase intentions in SSCCs. These relationships are important because the use of smart technology products requires large volumes of consumers’ personal information, which can lead to severe privacy issues when adopting SSCCs. Accordingly, consumers’ preferences for features of sustainable products could conflict with their privacy concerns when they disclose personal information. Thus, we investigate the relationship between the several benefits of SSCCs and privacy-related decisions when purchasing SSCCs. We propose an extended privacy trade-off model based on three critical assumptions: two types of privacy trade-offs, bidirectional privacy reduction, and anchoring effects. We also investigate the effects of government subsidies for purchasing SSCCs regarding the relationship between governments, companies, and consumers. To validate our model, we test the effects of interaction between privacy concerns and the benefits of SSCCs on disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. Our repeated tests for the various benefits of SSCCs demonstrate the robustness of the model. Our results indicate that when consumers consider purchasing SSCCs, sustainability plays the role of the common good in trading for privacy concerns. In addition, government subsidies to encourage companies’ sustainable products increase disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. We conclude that the status of sustainability as a common goal among governments, companies, and consumers represents an opportunity to balance the privacy tensions in the sale and purchase of SSCCs. © 2023

ABSTRACT: In the coming years, mobility initiatives should focus on sustainability, safety, and social equity. This can be achieved by introducing innovative transportation methods, implementing novel approaches for end-users, and optimizing the utilization of traditional modes of transport. To achieve this goal, it is essential to utilize pervasive sensing and computing technologies, along with intelligent information processing systems, to assist decision makers, managers, and transport operators. To effectively address unforeseen events and disruptions, mobility services should promptly adapt and improve their flexibility. Furthermore, these services should be adaptable to meet the unique needs and evolving demands of individuals. Current research focuses on understanding how individuals make decisions about when and where they engage in walking, driving, and travel activities. Therefore, it is important to develop reliable human mobility models in this context. Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are important in this context as they enable data generators to identify individual patterns and quickly adapt solutions. This paper aims to conduct a literature review on Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), focusing on personalization, to identify gaps in current MaaS initiatives. This assessment is essential for creating inclusive, user-friendly, personalized, and customizable MaaS solutions. To conclude, the existing challenges have been addressed in comprehending the characteristics of MaaS in terms of personalization. Additionally, they have been proposed further research questions to delve deeper into this aspect. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The demand for data centers has increased in recent years due to the need for businesses to store, process, and manage vast quantities of data, as well as the swift advancements in information technology and digitalization. As more organizations adopt technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, and storage capacity, their requirements for computational power, rapid data access, and storage capacity grow. Furthermore, the significance of data centers has been further emphasized due to the growing prevalence of remote working options, online platforms, and other digital services. Data centers typically comprise infrastructure such as high-performance servers, data storage systems, network infrastructure, cooling systems, and power conversion systems. Particularly high-performance servers and the cooling systems employed to dissipate the heat produced by them are characterized by their exceptionally high and relatively flexible energy consumption characteristics. The high energy consumption rate of data centers has become so significant that it constituted 1.7% of global energy consumption by 2022. With such high energy consumption, the flexible load characteristic of data centers allowing energy demand to be adjusted over time makes them valuable and suitable players to participate in demand-side management (DSM). This contributes to sustainability efforts by making the energy use of data centers more effective and economical. To achieve this, it is essential to develop decision-making tools that accurately estimate data center energy demand and create optimal energy management schedules. In this chapter, an analysis of trends in data center energy consumption, power models, and their role in DSM is covered. Additionally, a case study involving the development of a decision support system comprising forecasting and optimization modules is provided. It is concluded that the proposed approach can lead to in a 16.9% decrease in the energy costs of data centers. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: With the advancement of digital technologies, digital agriculture improves agricultural efficiency and sustainability, reducing resource waste and environmental burden. Hence, DA has emerged as a new catalyst for grain productivity and a driving force behind climate improvement, with broad prospects. However, digital agriculture is still in its early stage in most countries and there are few systematic reviews. In China, for example, there were only 3 non-core reviews out of 817 literatures on DA. Meanwhile, the use of Citespace is revolutionary as it leverages data visualization to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within literatures, aiding researchers in achieving their objectives. This study aims to address this research gap by using Citespace to produce a non-subjective and testable review on DA. In this study, we collected 2264 literatures by retrieving the WoS database in the timespan 1997-2022. The results show that 1) over time, the annual number of publications on DA has gradually increased and the research can be roughly divided into three stages: start-up, steady development, and rapid development stage; 2) research streams of DA can be further divided into six categories: Remote Sensing, Climate-Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data and System Integration; 3) development of research frontiers could be divided into three parts: 'exploration of digital agriculture technologies,' 'operation management of digital agriculture' and 'limitations of digital agriculture;' 4) future research should pay more attention to the innovation and scientific evaluation of digital technology and operation management. Also, effective DA policies should be put forward to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference. © 2013 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Various industrial eras have seen a transformation due to emerging technologies. Numerous innovative technologies, such as cobots, cloud computing, virtual reality, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as a result of Industry 5.0. Three guiding principles-human centricity, flexibility, and sustainability-direct Industry 5.0. The process of identifying human diseases remains difficult despite the "smart healthcare industry 5.0" and information technology improvements. Precise forecasting of human ailments, particularly fatal cancers, is essential for individuals' well-being in the intelligent healthcare sector 5.0. The proposed model is further supported by a fused weighted deep extreme machine learning (FDEML) strategy for enhanced lung disease prediction. The suggested FDEML system has confirmed to be the most reliable diagnosis of cancer sickness in the smart healthcare sector 5.0. The proposed FDEML approach surpassed the most sophisticated published techniques, receiving a score of 97.1%. © 2024, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The demand for high quality foods has steadily increased as response to market pressures and to other factors. The concept of food quality (FQ) gradually evolved to address changes in consumer perceptions and due to available technological advances. Evolution followed from FQ 1.0 (defective foods removal) over FQ 2.0 (prevention-based quality assurance), FQ 3.0 (total quality management; TQM), and finally the upcoming concept of FQ 4.0 that is focused on advanced technologies (Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence, etc.) for improving traceability, food safety, and quality assurance. This evolution from FQ 1.0 up to 4.0 followed perfection of conventional/advanced methods and the expansion of their scope to include the reductions of waste/pollution. This manuscript provides background and brief overview for current and traditional concepts of FQ with consumers in focus while mentioning techniques that are traditionally used for FQ assessments. Also, it describes migration toward FQ 4.0 and how it compares with traditional FQ, while considering products, processes, systems, and sustainable (nano)technologies for improvements of manufacturing and waste reductions. Such information is useful for practical guides for stakeholders in food chain (e.g., food managers, technologists, and consultants). Findings implied importance for developing the area within the “FQ 4.0 triangle,” whose three edges are “food science,” “quality assurance,” and “industry 4.0 (that has the tools/technologies to support this industrial concept).” This area has numerous opportunities for various applications in food sector and for gathering knowledge, currently needed in the food industry. Including data on the suitability of advanced technologies for food manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing), their association with quality/safety, reduction of waste/contaminants, all in order to reach sustainable food production. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Improving energy efficiency is crucial for achieving the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. The digital economy, which is characterized by big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and a new generation of mobile Internet, has quietly penetrated all aspects of the economy and society, profoundly changing the means of production and lives of human beings. Digital technologies have great potential to improve the global energy system’s security, productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in mainland China from 2006 to 2021, this study divided energy efficiency into total and single factor energy efficiency. The two-way fixed-effect model and the Driscol-Kraay method were used to adjust the standard error test in order to examine the impact of digital technology represented by industrial robots on energy efficiency and its path mechanism. Studies have shown that digital technology can significantly improve total factor energy efficiency and reduce energy intensity per unit of GDP. This conclusion was found to be still valid after the robustness test using feasible generalized least squares, time-varying difference in difference and fixed effect space Durbin model. The results of the mechanism test show that digital technology can improve energy efficiency by increasing the degree of industrial virtual agglomeration and the channels of foreign direct investment. This paper provides a valuable discussion on how information technology advances can improve energy efficiency in the era of the digital economy. The conclusions will help relevant market players to formulate policies and measures and corporate strategies to improve energy efficiency. At the same time, it also deepens the theoretical understanding and mechanism path of digital technology’s impact on energy consumption. © 2024, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

ABSTRACT: The sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship is deeply embedded in tradition – the Hippocratic oath, medical ethics, professional codes of conduct, and legislation – all of which are being disrupted by big data and ‘artificial’ intelligence (AI). The transition from paper-based records to electronic health records, wearables, mobile health applications and mobile phone data has created new opportunities to scale up data collection. Databases of unimaginable magnitude can be harnessed to develop algorithms for AI and to refine machine learning. Complex neural networks now lie at the core of ubiquitous AI systems in healthcare. A transformed healthcare environment enhanced by innovation, robotics, digital technology, and improved diagnostics and therapeutics is plagued by ethical, legal and social challenges. Global guidelines are emerging to ensure governance in AI, but many low- and middle-income countries have yet to develop context-specific frameworks. Legislation must be developed to frame liability and account for negligence due to robotics in the same way human healthcare providers are held accountable. The digital divide between high- and low-income settings is significant and has the potential to exacerbate health inequities globally. © 2024 South African Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The digital transformation and modernisation that the world is undergoing undoubtedly also applies to tourism. This includes a whole range of technologies that make it more efficient to build products that are more sensitive to travellers’ signals, as well as more empathetic to the possibilities of host communities, their natural environments, and other stakeholders. The volume and volatility of these technologies are high, making it a challenge to choose the best one to evolve, allowing one to recreate and imagine new scenarios towards previously unimagined experiences. For this purpose, the most used technologies in each of the links in the tourism value chain were mapped, concluding that the most used technologies are augmented reality, geolocation, big data, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence; the most representative actor being the tourist, in addition, absences of information were identified in actors such as the government and the host communities. Finally, we suggest thematic lines to continue with this research. Copyright © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This paper seeks to shed light on the relationship between firm digitalization and the likelihood of launching sustainable innovations (social and environmental, social only, and environmental only), for which the extant research has provided a paucity of evidence. In detail, the role of digitalization is considered in terms of (i) the specific effect of a given digital technology (DT)—among artificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics, smart devices, big data analytics, high speed infrastructure, and blockchain—and (ii) the effect of the concurrent adoption of multiple DTs (degree of digitalization). Furthermore, the paper assesses if and how the effect of the degree of digitalization is moderated by the implementation of sustainability practices, as the two issues are often treated independently. Research questions are proposed instead of hypotheses. Econometric analysis to answer proposed questions is based on a sample of 14,125 firms, whose information is gathered from the survey Flash Eurobarometer 486. Results reveal that each DT differently affects the likelihood of launching sustainable innovations, while the degree of digitalization is always beneficial. Moreover, it appears that firm digitalization and the adoption of sustainability practices are not complementary. All in all, this paper helps to illuminate current representations of the interplay between digitalization, sustainability practices, and sustainable innovations at the firm level, with implications for research, managerial practice, and policymaking. © 2023 The Author.

ABSTRACT: In the fight against climate change, and to improve its sustainability standards, the building sector is trying to reduce its energy consumption and environmental footprint. Leveraging digitalization, in the wake of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, holds immense potential in revolutionizing the buildings and construction sector. Digitalization is transforming buildings throughout their life cycle encompassing design, construction, operation, and retrofitting/decommissioning stages. This study aims to analyze the role of digital technologies in sustainable buildings. In doing so, a systematic literature review is conducted to examine the current landscape of the application of 13 key digital technologies - sensors, Building information modeling (BIM), Building Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, 3D printing/additive manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends, challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible, energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real-time data collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30%–50% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040. While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer awareness and a skilled workforce. Conducive policies and regulations are critical for creating an enabling environment that supports the adoption of digital technologies. © 2024

ABSTRACT: The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in smart cities has resulted in enhanced efficiency, accessibility, and improved quality of life. However, this integration has brought forth new challenges, particularly concerning data security and privacy due to the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The article aims to provide a classification of scientific research relating to artificial intelligence in smart city issues and to identify emerging directions of future research. A systematic literature review based on bibliometric analysis of Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted for the study. Research query included TITLE-ABS-KEY (“smart city” AND “artificial intelligence”) in the case of Scopus and TS = (“smart city” AND “artificial intelligence”) in the case of the Web of Sciences database. For the purpose of the analysis, 3101 publication records were qualified. Based on bibliometric analysis, seven research areas were identified: safety, living, energy, mobility, health, pollution, and industry. Urban mobility has seen significant innovations through AI applications, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), electric vehicles (EVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), yet security concerns persist, necessitating further research in this area. AI's impact extends to energy management and sustainability practices, demanding standardised regulations to guide future research in renewable energy adoption and developing integrated local energy systems. Additionally, AI's applications in health, environmental management, and the industrial sector require further investigation to address data handling, privacy, security, and societal implications, ensuring responsible and sustainable digitisation in smart cities. © 2023 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Plants sequester carbon through photosynthesis and provide primary productivity for the ecosystem. However, they also simultaneously consume water through transpiration, leading to a carbon-water balance relationship. Agricultural production can be regarded as a form of carbon sequestration behavior. From the perspective of the natural-social-economic complex ecosystem, excessive water usage in food production will aggravate regional water pressure for both domestic and industrial purposes. Hence, achieving a harmonious equilibrium between carbon and water resources during the food production process is a key scientific challenge for ensuring food security and sustainability. Digital intelligence (DI) and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) are emerging as the new research paradigms that are causing a substantial shift in the conventional thinking and methodologies across various scientific fields, including ecological science and sustainability studies. This paper outlines our recent efforts in using advanced technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), digital twins, metaverses, and parallel intelligence to model, analyze, and manage the intricate dynamics and equilibrium among plants, carbon, and water in arid and semiarid ecosystems. It introduces the concept of the carbon-water balance and explores its management at three levels: the individual plant level, the community level, and the natural-social-economic complex ecosystem level. Additionally, we elucidate the significance of agricultural foundation models as fundamental technologies within this context. A case analysis of water usage shows that, given the limited availability of water resources in the context of the carbon-water balance, regional collaboration and optimized allocation have the potential to enhance the utilization efficiency of water resources in the river basin. A suggested approach is to consider the river basin as a unified entity and coordinate the relationship between the upstream, midstream and downstream areas. Furthermore, establishing mechanisms for water resource transfer and trade among different industries can be instrumental in maximizing the benefits derived from water resources. Finally, we envisage a future of agriculture characterized by the integration of digital, robotic and biological farming techniques. This vision aims to incorporate small tasks, big models, and deep intelligence into the regular ecological practices of intelligent agriculture. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.

ABSTRACT: Water is crucial for enduring horticultural productivity, but high water-use requirements and declining water supplies with the changing climate challenge economic viability, environmental sustainability, and social justice. While the scholarly literature pertaining to water management in horticulture abounds, knowledge of practices and technologies that optimize water use is scarce. Here, we review the scientific literature relating to water requirements for horticulture crops, impacts on water resources, and opportunities for improving water- and transpiration-use efficiency. We find that water requirements of horticultural crops vary widely, depending on crop type, development stage, and agroecological region, but investigations hitherto have primarily been superficial. Expansion of the horticulture sector has depleted and polluted water resources via overextraction and agrochemical contamination, but the extent and significance of such issues are not well quantified. We contend that innovative management practices and irrigation technologies can improve tactical water management and mitigate environmental impacts. Nature-based solutions in horticulture—mulching, organic amendments, hydrogels, and the like—alleviate irrigation needs, but information relating to their effectiveness across production systems and agroecological regions is limited. Novel and recycled water sources (e.g., treated wastewater, desalination) would seem promising avenues for reducing dependence on natural water resources, but such sources have detrimental environmental and human health trade-offs if not well managed. Irrigation practices including partial root-zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation evoke remarkable improvements in water use efficiency, but require significant experience for efficient implementation. More advanced applications, including IoT and AI (e.g., sensors, big data, data analytics, digital twins), have demonstrable potential in supporting smart irrigation (focused on scheduling) and precision irrigation (improving spatial distribution). While adoption of technologies and practices that improve sustainability is increasing, their application within the horticultural industry as a whole remains in its infancy. Further research, development, and extension is called for to enable successful adaptation to climate change, sustainably intensify food security, and align with other Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Worldwide the transport sector faces several issues related to the rising of traffic demand such as congestion, energy consumption, noise, pollution, safety, etc. Trying to stem the problem, the European Commission is encouraging a modal shift towards railway, considered as one of the key factors for the development of a more sustainable European transport system. This contribution proposes a synthetic methodology for the capacity and utilization analysis of complex interconnected rail networks; the procedure has a dual scope since it allows both a theoretically robust examination of suburban rail systems and a solid approach to be applied, with few additional and consistent assumptions, for feasibility or strategic analysis of wide networks (by efficiently exploiting the use of Big Data and/or available Open Databases). Artificial intelligence and cloud are leading to the digitalization of logistics and transport sectors and the development of smart railway terminals. Smart railways are made possible with next-generation technologies that bring new levels of safety, connectivity, and sustainability. The chapter scientifically founded ways to reduce costs based on the “wireless electro pneumatic brake” that is, energy– efficient innovative technology that reduces the main energy raw materials in the railway transport of Uzbekistan. Ways to reduce and increase energy efficiency on the basis of digital information and communication technologies are shown. Since currently very much attention is paid to environmentally friendly technologies, this type of technology is very environmentally friendly and safer than the current type of brakes. While this type of brakes can qualify for international standards. If their implementation takes several months, the benefit of their implementation can benefit from the year to the railway industry. On the basis of wireless electro-pneumatic brakes, an intra–train information and diagnostic system of a freight train is being implemented, which allows for continuous control and predictive monitoring of all critical and running parts of cars (“intelligent” freight train). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the literature related to the use of digital technologies for promoting circular economy (CE) in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive approach was adopted, involving bibliometric analysis, text-mining analysis and content analysis to meet three objectives (1) to unveil the evolutionary progress of the field, (2) to identify the key research themes in the field and (3) to identify challenges hindering the implementation of digital technologies for CE. Findings: A total of 365 publications was analysed. The results revealed eight key digital technologies categorised into two main clusters including “digitalisation and advanced technologies” and “sustainable construction technologies”. The former involved technologies, namely machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data analytics and object detection and computer vision that were used for (1) forecasting construction and demolition (C&D) waste generation, (2) waste identification and classification and (3) computer vision for waste management. The latter included technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and building information modelling (BIM) that help optimise resource use, enhance transparency and sustainability practices in the industry. Overall, these technologies show great potential for improving waste management and enabling CE in construction. Originality/value: This research employs a holistic approach to provide a status-quo understanding of the digital technologies that can be utilised to support the implementation of CE in construction. Further, this study underlines the key challenges associated with adopting digital technologies, whilst also offering opportunities for future improvement of the field. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, precision agriculture and smart farming have been deployed by leaps and bounds as arable land has become increasingly scarce. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), by the year 2050, farming in the world should grow by about one-third above current levels. Therefore, farmers have intensively used fertilizers to promote crop growth and yields, which has adversely affected the nutritional improvement of foodstuffs. To address challenges related to productivity, environmental impact, food safety, crop losses, and sustainability, mobile robots in agriculture have proliferated, integrating mainly path planning and crop information gathering processes. Current agricultural robotic systems are large in size and cost because they use a computer as a server and mobile robots as clients. This article reviews the use of mobile robotics in farming to reduce costs, reduce environmental impact, and optimize harvests. The current status of mobile robotics, the technologies employed, the algorithms applied, and the relevant results obtained in smart farming are established. Finally, challenges to be faced in new smart farming techniques are also presented: environmental conditions, implementation costs, technical requirements, process automation, connectivity, and processing potential. As part of the contributions of this article, it was possible to conclude that the leading technologies for the implementation of smart farming are as follows: the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile robotics, artificial intelligence, artificial vision, multi-objective control, and big data. One technological solution that could be implemented is developing a fully autonomous, low-cost agricultural mobile robotic system that does not depend on a server.

ABSTRACT: The metaverse is a burgeoning technological domain, ranging from data-driven algorithms to advanced artificial intelligence. Immersive virtual reality does not reflect the ecological crisis in fictional worlds through interactivity. In the footsteps of Félix Guattari, this article elaborates on ecological thinking in three categories, each of which reflects the ecological risk and potential positive improvement of the metaverse. In the first category, environmental ecology, the article argues that the technological infrastructure of the metaverse is intensely power-consuming and materialises data and information fluxes. Moreover, the structure of digitised societies promotes intangible production. In the second category, social ecology, it argues that cognitive capitalism further stimulates consumerism because of big data classification and user-targeted algorithms and further amplifies climate change due to the empowered logistics industry. Additionally, capitalism causes continuous competence in the culture industry, leading to a high elimination rate of device production and low efficiency of intellectual labour. In the last category, mental ecology, the article argues that by precisely targeting users, the attention economy of the metaverse empowers individuals who are eager to pursue valorisation. These digital dwellers overlook ecological issues and the foundations of their virtual lives. In the posthumanist approach, humans are flattened by capitalism and become surplus value as natural forces. Humans’ minds are alienated from the idea that nature and humans coexist. Instead, the metaverse is directed toward individual power that immerses itself in a capital-driven network of information technology. This article proposes the merit of forming a nature-culture continuum to promote an ecological ideology in the metaverse. On the one hand, the nature-culture continuum of the metaverse spreads ecological knowledge and praxis via interactivity. On the other hand, the key mediation of nature-human metabolism through human labour contributes to environmentally friendly products, which cultivate an ecological culture of consumerism. Thus, the metaverse functions in a posthumanist context that consumes nature and humans for profit; however, the metaverse can also arouse thoughts of sustainability. © 2023 Critical Arts.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence is widely recognized as a pivotal component and a substantial component for sustainability growth within the domain of Fourth Industrial Revolution. despite the presence of noteworthy instances of achievement, certain research studies reveal that various sectors have exhibited a sluggishness in embracing artificial intelligence beyond the first proof-of-concept phase and incorporating it on a large scale inside their organizations. In order to examine this matter, a comprehensive research has been undertaken to investigate the elements that motivate and impede the implementation of artificial intelligence and assess the preparedness of various businesses in integrating artificial intelligence and big data technologies into their respective organizational frameworks. In order to obtain valuable insights on the viewpoints of industry professionals about the influence of artificial intelligence on business models and interactions with consumers, a structured questionnaire consisting of closed-ended questions has been designed and disseminated among the participants. Furthermore, a comprehensive strategic study has been undertaken utilizing the SWOT framework. The research has found a number of prominent obstacles, including inadequate availability of information technology infrastructure and proficient artificial intelligence expertise, inadequate access to superior data, insufficiently compelling justifications for company ventures, and intricate issues pertaining to legislation, regulations, and ethical considerations. The successful adoption and integration of artificial intelligence into business operations will heavily depend on the ability of industries to effectively tackle these difficulties. © 2024 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Geochemical surveys are a cornerstone for data generation in geosciences, facilitating resource exploration. Geochemical data is essential for identifying mineralized areas, understanding local geology and assessing environmental impacts. This paper aims to: (1) review the process of geochemical data generation to gain an appreciation of the characteristics of traditional geochemical data; (2) review recent developments in the usage of geochemical data, particularly the disruption brought forth by those in data science and artificial intelligence; and (3) envision a future specification of geochemical data that would be fit-for-purpose for modern and emerging data users. This review reveals that benefits brought by advancements in automation, analytical technique and computing capability have unlocked unprecedented insights from geochemical data. However, the sustainability of re-purposing small geochemical data for big data methods is intrinsically questionable. The mismatch stems from rapidly changing data requirements in geochemistry, which is brought forth by: (1) a pivot away from scientific reduction through the adoption of system-level methods; (2) developments in geometallurgy; (3) skill gaps in geoscientific education; and (4) a growing demand of raw materials. While traditional methods will likely continue to serve many scientific needs, new strategies and techniques must be developed and implemented to cost effectively and efficiently generate bigger geochemical data. Bigger geochemical data must emerge in response to the already changing landscape of geochemical data usage. Solutions are multidimensional, from evolving geoscientific education, leveraging modern technology, explicating and differentiating data user and generator roles and responsibilities, to modernizing data management. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: As the world has made significant progress against the COVID-19 pandemic and world economies rebound, climate change and the broader subject of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) have become critical issues for companies worldwide. Nowhere is this experienced more than in the information technology (IT) industry, given its size and impact on consumers worldwide. The IT industry is rapidly changing with the evolution of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the expansion of 5G networks resulting in the creation of massive quantities of information. Industry analysts estimate that the amount of data created, captured, or replicated will grow from 33 Zettabytes (ZB) in 2018 to 175 ZB by 2025. Given the focus on sustainability and the large volumes of storage devices required to store the growing quantities of data in the coming years, organizations have an opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint, improve sustainability, and reduce expenses by migrating less frequently accessed (cold data) from hard disk drive (HDD)-based storage to modern tape storage. Industry analysts believe that 60%-80% of the data stored on HDDs is cold data. Consider a hypothetical example of assessing just the impact of the storage media of keeping 100 Pbyte of information for 10 years. Compared to an HDD-only solution, an active archive that moved 60% of the HDD resident data to tape reduced carbon emissions by 58%, reduced electronic waste (eWaste) by 51%, and reduced the total cost of ownership (TCO) by 46%. In addition, if all the data is cold and is transferred to tape, carbon emissions are reduced by 97%, eWaste is decreased by 85%, and TCO is lowered by 78%. Globally, moving 60% of the HDD resident data to tape could reduce global carbon emissions by 79 million tons, making a meaningful contribution to reducing global carbon emissions. For enterprises, the financial benefits are significant enough to raise the possibility of funding the migration project entirely by the TCO savings while helping reduce global carbon emissions and eWaste. © 2002 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to dynamic mobility management can support the achievement of efficiency and sustainability goals. AI can help to model alternative mobility system scenarios in real time (by processing big data from heterogeneous sources in a very short time) and to identify network and service configurations by comparing phenomena in similar contexts, as well as support the implementation of measures for managing demand that achieve sustainable goals. In this paper, an in-depth analysis of scenarios, with an IT (Information Technology) framework based on emerging technologies and AI to support sustainable and cooperative digital mobility, is provided. Therefore, the definition of the functional architecture of an AI-based mobility control centre is defined, and the process that has been implemented in a medium-large city is presented. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, geospatial big data (GBD) has obtained attention across various disciplines, categorized into big earth observation data and big human behavior data. Identifying geospatial patterns from GBD has been a vital research focus in the fields of urban management and environmental sustainability. This paper reviews the evolution of GBD mining and its integration with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. GBD consists of data generated by satellites, sensors, mobile devices, and geographical information systems, and we categorize geospatial data based on different perspectives. We outline the process of GBD mining and demonstrate how it can be incorporated into a unified framework. Additionally, we explore new technologies like large language models (LLM), the Metaverse, and knowledge graphs, and how they could make GBD even more useful. We also share examples of GBD helping with city management and protecting the environment. Finally, we discuss the real challenges that come up when working with GBD, such as issues with data retrieval and security. Our goal is to give readers a clear view of where GBD mining stands today and where it might go next. Authors

Sustainability with emerging digital transformation and underlying seamless connected infrastructure needs to address security and trust as key challenges for deployment and shaping up a new working paradigm. In the vision of pervasive communication where mobile applications are growing immensely with the potential of resource-restricted, low cost, high performance, and seamless user centric solutions without the need of a fixed infrastructure. However, resource-restrictions, seamless devices interaction and the varying performance of devices will make it difficult to ensure end-to-end security and trust. Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning are other popular technologies emerging for intelligent decision making, proliferation and managing the data in computing environment. Security assurance is an expression of a high-level organizational security policy to deal with trust to enhance the technology adaption and security risks. Owing the highly dynamic and heterogeneous network with inherent open connectivity, secure and trusted communications, protecting mobile devices, preserving privacy and determining the security assurance are still thrust research areas. To understand the technology sustainability, security objectives must be equally important as the functional objectives. In this chapter we explore the different IoT and Big Data opportunities, challenges and threats to represent explorative and descriptive analysis of security intimidations. This study reveals various security challenges and opportunities in current age of digital transformation with a big technological shift where sustainability of these fast moving technologies deployments as another global concern. Here we propose a Trusted Security assurance by Policy Design and Deployment Auditing Model. In the winding up possible solutions inspired by the well-known quote 'Practice makes man perfect', security best practice gaps has been identified and recommend enforcing of policy to enhance the significant adaptation of secure and trustworthy applications where information is pervading.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Research examining the rise of digital environmental governance, particularly at the subnational scale in China, is fairly limited. Critical questions regarding how digital technologies applied at the subnational level may shape or transform environmental governance are only beginning to be explored, given cities’ increasing role as sustainability experimenters and innovators. In this study, we investigate how smart city initiatives that incorporate big data, artificial intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, and information communication technologies, may play a role in the transformation towards a “digital China.” We conceptualize three major pathways by which digital technology could transform environmental governance in China: through the generation of new data to address existing environmental data gaps; by enhancing the policy analytical capacity of environmental actors through the use of automation, digitalization, and machine learning/artificial intelligence; and last, through reshaping subnational-national, and state-society interactions that may shift balances of power. With its dual prioritization of digital technologies and climate change, China presents an opportunity for examining digitalization trends and to identify gaps in governance and implementation challenges that could present obstacles to realizing the transformative potential of digital environmental management approaches. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: After Industry 1.0 for Mechanization, Industry 2.0 for Electrification, Industry 3.0 for Automation, and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) for Digitalization and networking, we are marching very fast towards Industry 5.0 for Personalization. We shall take a look at the applications and challenges of I4.0 especially in its main scope Artificial Intelligence (AI). I4.0 is mainly powered by the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems which, by default, are smart, autonomous systems that use algorithms to monitor and control machines, robots and vehicles. I4.0 expects everything in the supply chain to be very smart from manufacturing to warehousing and also logistics. I4.0 also interconnects with back-end systems, like Enterprise Resource Planning, to give companies an uninterrupted level of visibility and monitoring. Truly, I4.0 is a significant part of any organization's transformation towards digitalization. In I4.0, we move digitally from the Internet and client-server technologies to ubiquitous computing, bridging the gap of both logical and physical entities of cyber environments. It merges of Information Technology, Operational Technology which caters technologies like IoT, Big Data, cloud, etc., with additional catalysts like advanced robotics and AI which enable I4.0 with automation and optimization in entirely new ways that lead to opportunities for Innovation and Automation. IT systems are used for data-centric computing; IT systems monitor events, processes, and devices, and make adjustments in enterprise and industrial operations. I4.0 majorly targets Small and Medium Enterprise(SME) which is the economic backbone of any country. I4.0 tries to merge broadly nine digital industrial technologies: IOT, augmented reality, big data, autonomous robots, system integration, cloud computing-digital ubiquity, cyber security, simulation, and additive manufacturing. Hence, the challenges and applications also cater to all these interdependent technologies. When we say challenges, it spreads across these domains individually and also the combinations of these technologies. Hence, it gets complicated as the number of technologies being combined increases, also proportionately with the complexity of each technology. Along with these technological issues, I4.0 also needs to take care of ethical and sustainability issues which are more challenging. The challenges of I4.0 at the basic level spreads from defining the strategy for changing, maximizing results, and interconnections of various sections of the organization. Challenges also include personnel to adapt to the newer working environment, readiness to share the data with the integrated module. In other words, they should be assured of utmost data security and rely on the outcomes. It should mainly work for Circular Economy and Sustainability. Regarding the application of I4.0 especially AI, it covers all the domains, machines, and gadgets that make our thinking and lives better and easier. AI is not meant to replace human beings, but to support and add on to their skills and outcome. It caters to NLP, RPA, AI-optimized hardware to Market Automation. As the main aim is to mimic human thinking and response, it has to draw a conclusion out of hundreds or thousands options while considering ethical, efficiency, environmental, and humanity issues attached to it. Each one is a vast issue by itself. For example, RPA itself caters six more broad categories, i.e., SCM, HR, CRM, accounting, F/S, and healthcare. All these can be further divided. Things become complicated when they are merged for interdependency. AI-optimized hardware has varied applications in agriculture, household appliances, gadgets, teaching and learning, research, etc. Hence, I4.0 has varied applications for both industries and human livelihood. At the same time there are respective challenges which slows down the complete implementation of I4.0. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Sita Rani, Pankaj Bhambri, Sachin Kumar, Piyush Kumar Pareek, and Ahmed A.

ABSTRACT: Deep learning models have been widely used in various applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recently, in the field of drought forecasting/prediction. These models have proven to be effective in handling large and complex datasets, and in automatically extracting relevant features for forecasting. The use of deep learning models in drought forecasting can provide more accurate and timely predictions, which are crucial for the mitigation of drought-related impacts such as crop failure, water shortages, and economic losses. This review provides information on the type of droughts and their information systems. A comparative analysis of deep learning models, related technology, and research tabulation is provided. The review has identified algorithms that are more pertinent than others in the current scenario, such as the Deep Neural Network, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, and combination of hybrid models. The paper also discusses the common issues for deep learning models for drought forecasting and the current open challenges. In conclusion, deep learning models offer a powerful tool for drought forecasting, which can significantly improve our understanding of drought dynamics and our ability to predict and mitigate its impacts. However, it is important to note that the success of these models is highly dependent on the availability and quality of data, as well as the specific characteristics of the drought event. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT) and digitalization in the Industry 5.0 era have opened up new opportunities for reverse logistics management to become digitalized, smarter, more sustainable, and simplified by incorporating disruptive technologies, e.g., Internet-of-things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data analysis, simulation, blockchain, etc. Digital twin is one of the most promising concepts in Industry 5.0, which can re-create a physical object or system in the digital world. In this paper, different from the widely practiced product-based definitions, we extend this concept to a system-oriented digital reverse logistics twin. Based on a conceptual framework allowing for a high level of system integration, we present the key enabling elements for a digital reverse logistics twin that can support decisions in a complex and uncertain environment. Through an illustrative example of a remanufacturing network design problem in Norway, the initial proof-of-concept illustrates how different systems and models can be combined in a digital reverse logistics twin in order to support different decisions. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

ABSTRACT: NZCCs aim to minimise urban carbon emissions for healthier cities in line with national and international low-carbon targets and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many countries have recently adopted Net-Zero Carbon City (NZCC) policies and strategies. While there are many studies available on NZCC cities’ definitions and policymaking, currently, research is rare on understanding the role of urban data-driven technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as AI, for achieving the goals of NZCCs in relation to sustainable development goals (SDGs), e.g., SDGs 3, 7,11, 13, and 17. This paper aims to fill this gap by establishing a systematic review and ascertaining the opportunities and barriers of data-driven approaches, analytics, digital technologies, and AI for supporting decision-making and monitoring progress toward achieving NZCC development and policy/strategy development. Two scholarly databases, i.e., Web of Science and Scopus databases, were used to find papers based on our selected relevant keywords. We also conducted a desktop review to explore policies, strategies, and visualisation technologies that are already being used. Our inclusion/exclusion criteria refined our selection to 55 papers, focusing on conceptual and theoretical research. While digital technologies and data analytics are improving and can help in the move from net-zero carbon concepts and theories to practical analysis and the evaluation of cities’ emission levels and in monitoring progress toward reducing carbon, our research shows that these capabilities of digital technologies are not used thoroughly yet to bridge theory and practice. These studies ignore advanced tools like city digital twins and GIS-based spatial analyses. No data, technologies, or platforms are available to track progress towards a NZCC. Artificial Intelligence, big data collection, and analytics are required to predict and monitor the time it takes for each city to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. GIS and BIM can be used to estimate embodied carbon and predict urban development emissions. We found that smart city initiatives and data-driven decision-making approaches are crucial for achieving NZCCs. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Big data analytics (BDA) involves using sophisticated software tools to extract insights from large data sets, identify patterns, and make predictions. Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), on the other hand, refers to the use of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies to enable human-like conversations between machines and humans. BDA and conversational AI in the agriculture industry have risen in popularity in recent years. Agriculture plays a very significant role in the economic development of India. Nowadays, the prime concern of farmers is to satisfy the growing food demand by increasing the farm yield with the effective use of the existing and limited farmland resources. However, the agriculture sector is facing several challenges including climate change, resource depletion, pests and diseases, labor shortages, market volatility, and food security. In order to address these issues, advanced technologies such as big data analytics and conversational AI are utilized in agriculture to collect, process, and analyze large volumes of data generated by various farming operations. This data includes information about soil quality, weather patterns, crop yields, and other important factors that affect agricultural productivity, precision, and sustainability. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Tanvir Habib Sardar and Bishwajeet Kumar Pandey; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to compare the impact of Construction 4.0 technologies on different organizational core values, focusing on sustainability and resiliency, well-being, productivity, safety, and integrity. To achieve that aim, the study objectives are the following: (i) identify the critical Construction 4.0 technologies between core values; (ii) appraise overlapping critical Construction 4.0 technologies between core values; (iii) examine the ranking performance of Construction 4.0 technologies between core values; and (iv) analyze the interrelationships between Construction 4.0 technologies and core values. First, twelve Construction 4.0 technologies were identified from a national strategic plan. Then, the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) that incorporates subjective and objective weights was used to evaluate the impact of the Construction 4.0 technologies on the five core values. Finally, the collected data was analyzed using the following techniques: fuzzy TOPSIS, normalization, overlap analysis, agreement analysis, sensitivity analysis, ranking comparison, and Spearman correlation. The study findings reveal four critical Construction 4.0 technologies that enhance all five core values: building information modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), big data and predictive analytics, and autonomous construction. Also, there is a high agreement on the Construction 4.0 technologies that enhance well-being and productivity. Lastly, artificial intelligence (AI) has the highest number of very strong relationships among the core values. The originality of this paper lies in its comprehensive comparison of the impact of Construction 4.0 technologies on multiple organizational core values. The study findings provide valuable insights in making strategic decisions in adopting Construction 4.0 technologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: In simpler terms, our day-to-day life, from various urban sectors to all deep corners of city life, is becoming hugely influenced by digital platforms’ data systems, economic tactics, and ways of management. This is a trend that we call “platformization.” It’s taken us to a point where we now live in what’s often described as a “platform society” because these platforms now largely control urban civilizations. What’s fascinating is that this platformization trend has created something pretty striking: the Metaverse. The Metaverse is an impressive global platform project launched by Meta, the company we used to know as Facebook. This project brings to life a potential “virtual world” that mirrors our reality. The idea is that the Metaverse can serve as a virtual version of the future cities – not too different from what we think of as smart cities. Thanks to cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twins, we now have enough resources and understanding of human behavior to make a project like the Metaverse possible. The promise is that the Metaverse can revolutionize how we design cities and deliver public services, making cities more efficient, accountable, and with a higher quality performance. But of course, the arrival of the Metaverse isn’t without its worries. There are many questions over the ethical, human, social, and cultural implications the Metaverse may have. Particularly, there are concerns about the kind of impact it may have on the quality of human social relationships and how it may reshape urban life. To unpack all of these, this research work aims to thoroughly examine available literature on this topic. The paper further looks into the new products and services coming into being because of the Metaverse, examining how they might help smart cities, especially those aiming for better environment, economy, and social sustainability. The insights gathered here could help city leaders understand the Metaverse’s potential for technology-driven urban practices and future city plans. It also takes a critical stance, challenging whether the Metaverse might significantly change how reality is constructed in our increasingly platform-driven urban world. This discussion, hopefully, can fuel future research and critical conversation on this hot topic. © 2023 Copyright © 2023 Qadir et al., licensed to EAI.

ABSTRACT: Adopting Emerging Technologies (ET) can transform the Malaysian construction industry through improved productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. Although there is a growing body of literature on ET adoption, there remains a noticeable lack of comprehensive reviews specifically addressing the Malaysian construction industry. This study seeks to fill this gap by providing a systematic literature review (SLR) analysis of current research on ET adoption in the Malaysian construction industry. By examining 50 carefully selected and relevant journal articles, this investigation aims to highlight existing research gaps and potential future directions for industry professionals and academic researchers. The analysis revealed that prior research had studied nine groups of ETs: Advanced Materials, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Building Information Modelling (BIM), Blockchain, Cloud, Prefabrication & Modular, Internet of Things (IoT), Integrated, and Others. Also, the findings show no or limited research on five ETs that are part of the national strategic plan: 3D Printing & Additive Manufacturing, Autonomous Construction, 3D Scanning & Photogrammetry, and Big Data & Predictive Analytic. This study adds value to the existing literature by offering a comprehensive overview of research on ET adoption within the Malaysian construction industry. Moreover, identifying the knowledge gaps can illuminate potential avenues for future research in this domain. The study findings benefit industry practitioners, policymakers, and researchers interested in ET adoption in the Malaysian construction industry. © 2024, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This systematic literature review aims to investigate the application and integration of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in transportation infrastructure construction projects focusing on sustainability pillars. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a systematic literature review approach, combining qualitative review and quantitative analysis of 142 academic articles published between 2011 and March 2023. Findings: The findings reveal the dominance of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a central tool for sustainability assessment, while other technologies such as blockchain and autonomous robotics have received limited attention. The adoption of I4.0 technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Augmented Reality (AR), and Big Data, has been prevalent for data-driven analyses, while Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) and 3D printing are mainly being integrated either with BIM or in synergy with Artificial Intelligence (AI). We pinpoint critical challenges including high adoption costs, technical barriers, lack of interoperability, and the absence of standardized sustainability benchmarks. Originality/value: This research distinguishes itself by not only mapping the current integration of I4.0 technologies but also by advocating for standardization and a synergistic human-technology collaborative approach. It offers tailored strategic pathways for diverse types of transportation infrastructure and different project phases, aiming to significantly enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. The study sets a new agenda for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to meet ambitious future sustainability and efficiency goals, making a compelling case for rethinking how these technologies are applied in the construction sector. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This study explores the information regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI) included by European listed companies in their annual and/or sustainability reports. The study mainly focuses on (1) the development and use of AI systems/projects reported by companies, (2) the extent to which companies disclose ethical principles or guidelines regarding AI and (3) the factors explaining these practices. The study analyses the reports of 200 companies listed in the major indexes of Germany, Sweden, Finland, France, Spain, and Italy, both from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. All reports are analysed, using content analysis methodology, to identify expressions such as ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, and ‘big data’, and then classified accordingly. The study's findings suggest a growing interest in the above-mentioned technologies, although 41.5% of companies do not report any activity in the field of AI. The adoption of ethical approaches to AI is at a very preliminary stage, and<5% of companies report on that issue. The quantitative analysis shows that larger companies, companies in the Technology and Telecommunications industries, and companies based in Southern countries are more likely to disclose information on AI activity. The majority of companies that develop ethical principles are listed in the Northern region and belong to the Technology and Telecommunications industries. The study provides evidence of AI disclosure, a type of non-financial disclosure that has not been explored yet in the literature. Unlike existing studies, we propose a first definition of the topic and a taxonomy that can be used in further research on AI disclosure and can contribute to the development of KPIs in the field. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical framework integrating some traditional theories, such as Voluntary disclosure theory, Signalling theory, and Legitimacy theory, specifically drawn to interpret AI disclosure practices, which can help with a further in-depth exploration of AI disclosure combining concurrent perspectives. The study's results may serve as a starting point for researchers and companies interested in the topic. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: A major challenge of Sustainable Development Goal 12 “Responsible Consumption and Production” is to reduce food losses along production and supply chains. This is particularly critical for fresh food products, due to their perishable and fragile nature, which makes the coordination of the actors all the more crucial to avoid wastes and losses. The rise of new technologies, referred to as “Industry 4.0” powered by the internet of things, big data analytics and artificial intelligence, could bring new solutions to meet these needs. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) allow for frequent exchanges of huge amounts of information between actors in the agrofood chains to coordinate their activities. The aim of the chapter is to provide a state-of-the-art analysis on ICTs used in agrofood supply chains, with a special focus on the case of fresh fruits and vegetables, to analyze the potential and weaknesses which exist in different forms of supply chains for ICTs becoming a “resource” (precious, rare, non-imitable, and nonsubstitutable) prospect and to suggest promising ICTs in this context. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Modern cyber systems acquire more emergent system properties, as far as their complexity increases: cyber resilience, controllability, self-organization, proactive cyber security and adaptability. Each of the listed properties is the subject of the cybernetics research and each subsequent feature makes sense only if there is a previous one. Cyber resilience is the most important feature of any cyber system, especially during the transition to the sixth technological stage and related Industry 4.0 technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud and foggy computing, 5G +, IoT/IIoT, Big Data and ETL, Q-computing, Blockchain, VR/AR, etc. We should even consider the cyber resilience as a primary one, because the mentioned systems cannot exist without it. Indeed, without the sustainable formation made of the interconnected components of the critical information infrastructure, it does not make sense to discuss the existence of 4.0 Industry cyber-systems. In case when the cyber security of these systems is mainly focused on the assessment of the incidents’ probability and prevention of possible security threats, the cyber resilience is mainly aimed at preserving the targeted behavior and cyber systems’ performance under the conditions of known (about 45 %) as well as unknown (the remaining 55 %) cyber attacks. This monograph shows that modern Industry 4.0. Cyber systems do not have the required cyber resilience for targeted performance under heterogeneous mass intruder cyber-attacks. The main reasons include a high cyber system structural and functional complexity, a potential danger of existing vulnerabilities and “sleep” hardware and software tabs, as well as an inadequate efficiency of modern models, methods, and tools to ensure cyber security, reliability, response and recovery. A new formulation of the cyber resilience problem under heterogeneous mass cyber-attacks is proposed, in which the cyber system performance recovery in destructive software impacts prevents significant or catastrophic consequences. Here, the idea of ensuring the cyber resilience is to give the cyber systems the ability to develop immunity to disturbances of the computational processes under destructive influences, by analogy with the immune system protecting a living organism. The book contains three chapters, devoted to the following topics: Development of the Cyber Resilience Management Concept of modern technological platforms and cyber-systems of 4.0 Industry; Development of a corporate cyber risk management methodology; Technical implementation of the corporate program of business sustainability management based on the best practices (standards). © 2019 River Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Water quality monitoring and its use in smart agriculture and other crucial domains is an important step towards a system based on risk analysis on how data is transmitted over the network. In this article, the emphasis is on the security of the transmitted data and is based on the developed project SWAM (Smart WAter Management system for better environmental sustainability). The security services used in the current paper are based on an architecture that provides a set of security guarantees capable of mitigating certain threats relevant to the water quality monitoring system used in agriculture. These services are beneficial for irrigation system operators because the devices are authenticated, then the data is sent from the station and reaches the platform and is not modified in the sense of simulating erroneous measurements. The general purpose of the article is to describe the security aspect, elements and factors of the SWAM architecture. Security is required at all IoT levels, for example, at the device level, including sensors for water quality monitoring and communication level (generally through the Gateway).  © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Ubiquitous technology, big data, more efficient electronic health records, and predictive analytics are now at the core of smart healthcare systems supported by artificial intelligence. In the present narrative review, we focus on sensing technologies for the healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We employed a framework inspired by the Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory (IPNB), which posits that human experience is characterized by a flow of energy and information both within us (within our whole body), and between us (in the connections we have with others and with nature). In line with this framework, we focused on sensors designed to evaluate bodily processes (body sensors such as implantable sensors, epidermal sensors, and wearable and portable sensors), human social interaction (sociometric sensors), and the physical environment (indoor and outdoor ambient sensors). There is a myriad of man-made sensors as well as nature-based sensors such as plants that can be used to design and deploy intelligent systems for human monitoring and healthcare. In conclusion, sensing technologies and intelligent systems can be employed for smarter healthcare of AN and help to relieve the burden of health professionals. However, there are technical, ethical, and environmental sustainability issues that must be considered prior to implementing these systems. A joint collaboration of professionals and other members of the society involved in the healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the development of these systems. The evolution of cyberphysical systems should also be considered in these collaborations.  © 2022 Carlos A. Almenara et al.

ABSTRACT: The use of digital technologies has been recognized as one of the great challenges for businesses of the 21st century. This digitalization is characterized by the intensive use of information technologies in the different stages of the value chain of a sector. In this context, smart agriculture is transforming the agricultural sector in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In some countries, cooperatives, as the most common legal form of the incumbent companies, in this rather traditional low-intensive technology sector, are going to develop a relevant role in the process of adoption of these technologies. In this context, this paper provides, first, a review of the evolution of the main digital technologies, such as Internet of Things, robots, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Blockchain, among others. Second, a description of the digital innovation process in agri-cooperatives in order to help them in the decision-making process, and third, a digital diagnosis tool for measuring cooperatives' digital innovation. This tool is initially applied to two cases of agri-cooperatives in Spain. All of this contributes to a better understanding of digitalization of agri-cooperatives in the context of smart agriculture. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Innovative technologies enable businesses to stay competitive in marketplace while also increasing profits in manufacturing of nanocomposites for water treatment. Aforementioned driving factors resulted in adoption of a number of innovative technologies, and no other trend has had a greater impact in recent years than Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a comprehensive term that encompasses data management, manufacturing competitiveness, manufacturing processes, and efficiency. The term "Industry 4.0"refers to a group of key enabler technologies, such as cyber physical models, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics, including embedded devices which are all significant components to the mechanized and digitized industrial environments. AI approaches have been used for water treatment processes as well as desalination in recent years for optimizing the process along with providing realistic answers to water scarcity and water pollution-related issues. AI applications have been used to predict and minimize water treatment process operational costs by lowering costs and optimizing chemical utilization. Several AI models are successful and accurate in predicting effectiveness of various adsorbents used in the removal process of a variety of contaminants from water. To identify the current level of research and future development prospects of smart manufacturing, this study uses a comprehensive literature review technique for manufacturing sustainability of nanocomposite fabrication for water treatment applications. The model provided will help to create a baseline for AI and hybrid models in the water treatment and wastewater management sectors, allowing for the increased performance and innovative growth. It will serve to provide the framework and give guidance for researchers interested in creating superior nanocomposites for waste and fresh water treatment and management using Industry 4.0. This study looks at a variety of AI approaches as well as how they may be used in water treatment, with an emphasis on pollutant adsorption. This assessment also identified certain obstacles and research gaps in the field of AI applications in water treatment processes.  © 2022 Jean Yves Uwamungu et al.

ABSTRACT: A recent shift in the way people live, work and develop knowledge demands unlocking insights from personal, organizational, and market data. Starting with ingestion, processing, visualization, interactions through insights, cross-team efforts, and decision-making processes, artificial intelligence-based IT support systems are no longer an option in day-to-day activities but an imperative for reaching today's organizations' innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness goals. A consistent automation framework for the needed infrastructure, data, IT assets, and life cycle management is highly related to sustainability, security, compatibility, compliance, and legal regulations. The biggest challenge remains the continuous progress in both infrastructure and software advancements. This paper addresses the challenges of modern businesses' digitalization, states, and demonstrates the solution through flexible, consumption-based information technology services. The purpose is to accelerate the transition from capital expenditures to operating expenses, thereby accelerating innovation and enhancing agility, security, compliance, flexibility, and cost control. The ultimate goal is to use IT as a platform, shifting from an operations realm to an innovation driver, thus creating new revenue streams.  © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The scope of the present paper is to promote social, cultural and environmental sustainability in cities by establishing a conceptual framework and the relationship amongst safety in urban public space (UPS), lighting and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based surveillance. This framework uses available technologies and tools, as these can be found in urban equipment such as lighting posts, to enhance security and safety in UPS, ensuring protection against attempted criminal activity. Through detailed literary research, publications on security and safety concerning crime and lighting can be divided into two periods, the first one pre-1994, and the second one from 2004-2008. Since then, a significant reduction in the number of publications dealing with lighting and crime is observed, while at the same time, the urban nightscape has been reshaped with the immersion of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. Especially in the last decade, where most municipalities in the EU28 (European Union of all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020) are refurbishing their road lighting with LED technology and the consideration of smart networks and surveillance is under development, the use of lighting to deter possible attempted felonies in UPS is not addressed. To capitalize on the potential of lighting as a deterrent, this paper proposes a framework that uses existing technology, namely, dimmable LED light sources, presence sensors, security cameras, as well as emerging techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled image recognition algorithms and big data analytics and presents a possible system that could be developed as a stand-alone product to alert possible dangerous situations, deter criminal activity and promote the perception of safety thus linking lighting and ICT-based surveillance towards safety and security in UPS. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Voice search based on artificial intelligence is the fastest means of searching for information and can be easily used in a very familiar way by ordinary users without separate education or learning. Voice bot’s voice search can interact on the same level as face-to-face communication and provide customized services optimized for users. It is most important for these new technologies to develop from a non-face-to-face social structure caused by COVID-19 to a long-term sustainable technology rather than short-term development. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically verify the structural relationship between the quality, interactivity, and consumers’ sustainable use intentions for voice search services called ‘voice bots’ in Korea, an advanced country of computer science and technology. A survey was conducted on Korean consumers aged 20 or older who use voice search services, and the following main results were derived. First, the playfulness, certainty, and empathy of the ‘voice bot’ have a positive effect on the interactivity with the ‘voice bot’. Second, interactivity with the ‘voice bot’ has a positive effect on consumers’ sustainable use intention. Third, the playfulness and certainty of ‘voice bot’ have a positive effect on consumers’ sustainable use intention. Fourth, the playfulness, certainty, and empathy of the ‘voice bot’ have a positive effect on consumers’ sustainable use intention through interactivity with the ‘voice bot’. This study is meaningful in that it empirically identified the importance of interactivity by deriving the service quality factors required for sustainable use of voice search services, one of the new innovative technologies. © 2021 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Information and communication technologies (ICT) are playing an important role in the development of software platforms for Smart Cities to improve city services, sustainability, and citizen quality of life. Smart City software platforms have a significant role to transform a city into a smart city by providing support for the development and integration of intelligent services. Big data analytics is an emerging technology that has a huge potential to enhance smart city services by transforming city information into city intelligence. Despite this,it has attracted attention in a rather restricted range of application domains, and its joint application with self-adaptation mechanisms is rarely investigated. In this Ph.D. research, in collaboration with the Smart Cities and Communities Lab. of the Italian national agency ENEA, we focus on the design and development of a software platform for smart city based on self-adaptation, as realized in the IBM MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute over a shared Knowledge) control loop architecture model, and on machine intelligence, as provided by a big data analytics framework. This last is introduced in between the analysis and planning modules of the MAPE-K control loop model. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with a real showcase in the public lighting domain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: Sustainability awareness across various economic sectors requires firms to use logistics outsourcing to reduce logistics-related emissions with compliant logistics service providers (LSPs). LSPs apply advanced information technologies to help achieve high efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability goals. While logistics outsourcing has received considerable attention from researchers, limited research has identified the elements of logistics outsourcing and established research trends regarding technology and sustainability aspects of logistics outsourcing. This study aims to establish trends in technology and sustainability in logistics outsourcing and identify the important elements of logistics outsourcing. A bibliometric analysis technique using the Biblioshiny package in R. A SCOPUS search resulted in 2019 documents. Research on technology and sustainability in logistics outsourcing is growing, especially in developed countries, with little or no research from developing countries. Sustainable supply chains and third-party logistics themes dominated the past research. Current research is on reverse logistics, circular economy, and green logistics; the latter is likely to dominate the future, focusing on risk management, pollution control, and innovation through advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data. Essential elements of logistics outsourcing are identified as maintaining a good relationship based on trust and cooperation, LSP multi-selection criteria that include sustainability and technology capabilities, proper contract management, and an appropriate in-house versus outsourcing balance for competitiveness. LSP managers are advised to develop sustainability and technology capabilities, including reverse logistics. The paper contributes to logistics management theory by identifying the elements of logistics outsourcing and presenting a bibliometric result to guide future research on sustainability and technology capabilities in logistics outsourcing. © 2022 by the author.

ABSTRACT: The size of the business intelligence market and its growth allows to estimate the short-term substitution effect, when the labour is replaced by artificial intelligence. Positive impacts of disruptive technologies include the dematerialisation of the industrial metabolism, and less ecological impact on nature, as prerequisites for the implementation of a circular economy. The negative consequences of disruptive technologies are difficult to predict, and the paper classifies them in eight groups: psychological impact; information vulnerability; increasing information dependence; the risk of creative potential reduction; the increasing cost of waste in the green economy; loss of jobs; privacy decrease; hacking and the loss of human control over cyber systems. The Internet of Things could not appear before the digital technologies (from a personal computer to 'cloud' technologies) reached industrial maturity. Also, societal, legislation and economic challenges raised by disruptive technologies for workers and firms are discussed. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study presents a broad view of the current state of the art of ML applications in the manufacturing sectors that have a considerable impact on sustainability and the environment, namely renewable energies (solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass), smart grids, the industry of catalysis and power storage and distribution. Artificial neural networks are the most preferred techniques over other ML algorithms because of their generalization capabilities. Demands for ML techniques in the energy sectors will increase considerably in the coming years, since there is a growing demand of academic programmes related to artificial intelligence in science, math, and engineering. Data generation, management, and safety are expected to play a key role for the successful implementation of ML algorithms that can be shared by major stakeholders in the energy sector, thereby promoting the development of ambitious energy management projects. New algorithms for producing reliable data and the addition of other sources of information (e.g., novel sensors) will enhance flow of information between ML and systems. It is expected that unsupervised and reinforcement learning will take a central role in the energy sector, but this will depend on the expansion of other major fields in data science such as big data analytics. Massive implementations, specialized algorithms, and new technologies like 5G will promote the development of sustainable applications of ML in non-industrial applications for energy management. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

ABSTRACT: Intelligent organizational systems or intelligent organizations are being created through processes of digital transformation (DT) that typically involves intelligent technologies such as robotic process automation (RPA), the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), blockchain, drones, virtual reality (VR), 3D printing, big data and big data analytics (BDA). However, there is the significant problem of high DT failure rates with severe financial losses. Thus, understanding the key constructs for DT success in terms of organizational performance is an essential knowledge requirement and was the research problem and knowledge gap addressed by the study. The study followed an integrative literature review method since the purpose was analysis and synthesis for research model development. The study exposed the key constructs for successful DT in terms of organizational performance, namely organizational performance, sustainability, information technology (IT)/digital capability, change management, dynamic capabilities and risk management. This knowledge enables DT management to effectively manage DT toward success. For DT and related scientists, the study establishes the foundations for measuring DT and the associated organizational performance and facilitates DT theory progression and new knowledge generation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

ABSTRACT: New technologies brought about by digital transformation in the construction sector will inevitably lead to a change in the traditional ways of dealing with health and safety risk management as has occurred with other specialties such as architecture, structural, mechanical, electrical, heating and ventilation. Existing procedures will need to be adapted, and new routines are created. The technical and soft skills of employees will need to be updated, enhancing competitiveness and sustainability. Based upon ongoing research studies, this chapter aims to explain how health, safety and well-being (HSW) risk management and associated skills can be dealt with using technologies such as building information modelling, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things, teleoperation, soft skills, artificial intelligence applied to big data and cybersecurity. Fields where these key technological developments (KTD) can be applied include: technical training; documental/contractual management; hazards identification; on-site monitoring and implementation; emergency planning; and accident investigation. High-level risks including pedestrian/vehicle collisions and falls from heights will also be covered. Based on a review of the relevant literature, an analysis of the application of KTDs to the main fields indicated in EU directive 92/57/CE has been conducted. The main conclusions are that if correctly implemented, these new ways of handling risk management will enable a better perception of risks and enhanced preventive measures, allow improvement of training levels, logistic and financial management and, promote improved integration of prevention measures into work planning. Raising, the skills levels of HSW will be a key enabler for teams to increase their knowledge and understanding of KDT in HSW contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Timely and reliable information about crop management, production, and yield is consid-ered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: It is expected that 68% of the world’s population, over six billion people, will live in megacities and surrounding regions by 2050. A growing population requires the development of an infrastructure and the necessary facilities. Ineffective resource management leads to wasted energy and not meeting sustainability demands in the environment. The utilization of materials for facility management, like water supply and power supplies, do not satisfy the present requirements of sustainability. An increase in the infrastructure of smart cities has raised the demand for integrated facility management systems in residences. It is the responsibility of the individuals to save resources such as energy and water through proper planning and management. Smart materials and intelligent systems play a vital role in improving lifestyles by saving resources without wasting energy. With the help of smart sensor systems and AI-based technologies, it is possible to monitor and control the devices that we use in our day-to-day lives so that facilities and resources can be managed efficiently without wastage. This chapter proposes a framework for an intelligent facility management system for self-sustainable homes in smart cities by integrating building information modeling (BIM), artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and big-data analytics (BDA). © 2022 River Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming research through analysis of massive datasets and accelerating simulations by factors of up to a billion. Such acceleration eclipses the speedups that were made possible though improvements in CPU process and design and other kinds of algorithmic advances. It sets the stage for a new era of discovery in which previously intractable challenges will become surmountable, with applications in fields such as discovering the causes of cancer and rare diseases, developing effective, affordable drugs, improving food sustainability, developing detailed understanding of environmental factors to support protection of biodiversity, and developing alternative energy sources as a step toward reversing climate change. To succeed, the research community requires a high-performance computational ecosystem that seamlessly and efficiently brings together scalable AI, general-purpose computing, and large-scale data management. The authors, at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), launched a second-generation computational ecosystem to enable AI-enabled research, bringing together carefully designed systems and groundbreaking technologies to provide at no cost a uniquely capable platform to the research community. It consists of two major systems: Neocortex and Bridges-2. Neocortex embodies a revolutionary processor architecture to vastly shorten the time required for deep learning training, foster greater integration of artificial deep learning with scientific workflows, and accelerate graph analytics. Bridges-2 integrates additional scalable AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and high-performance parallel file systems for simulation, data pre- and post-processing, visualization, and Big Data as a Service. Neocortex and Bridges-2 are integrated to form a tightly coupled and highly flexible ecosystem for AI- and data-driven research. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Agriculture faces different environmental, economic and social challenges that make the case for transition towards sustainability. Digitization is one of the most significant ongoing transformation processes in global agriculture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) range from traditional communication aids (e.g. telephones, televisions), internet and mobile applications, to Big Data analytics and information systems, Cloud computing, Internet of Things, remote sensing and drones, blockchain and artificial intelligence. Different terms have been used to refer to the application of ICTs in agriculture e.g. digital agriculture, e-agriculture, smart agriculture, precision agriculture. This review paper analyses the potential of ICT in agricultural sector. In particular, it explores the benefits of ICT in terms of agriculture smartness and sustainability, provides an overview on the main technologies used, delineates the contours of the smart farming market and landscape, and analyses the potential drawbacks of such a ‘digital revolution’ in agriculture. Smart agriculture is presented by some scholars and practitioners as the ‘Third Green Revolution’, after the plant breeding and genetics revolutions. It is widely recognised that ICTs can help reducing inefficiencies, increasing resource productivity, decreasing management costs, and improving traceability and transparency. However, some caution is needed to make the ongoing ‘digital revolution’ in agriculture inclusive for small-scale farmers and women, especially in developing countries. Moreover, some threats and challenges relating to digital and smart technologies need to be appropriately addressed through policies to support the development of the necessary market and legal architecture for ICT and smart farming, with due consideration to ethical questions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

ABSTRACT: Focused on connectivity and enabled by smart technologies, the fourth industrial revolution is creating a digital transformation that is advancing and prompting sustainable groundwater (GW) management practices. Enabled by artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain technology, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and the Internet of Things, this digital transformation is creating a paradigm shift in how we manage our GW resources. The next generation GW management tools are emerging with web-based GW management platforms following FAIR Data Principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. These web-based platforms can improve participation, cooperation, and collective action, and enable alternative forms of GW management such as commons-based peer management of GW resources. These web-based platforms not only provide comprehensive and timely information about the GW system with simulation and gaming tools, but also enable agents to work cooperatively. In this chapter, we discuss GW sustainability in a digital world using examples from both developing and developed countries. We show how these web-based platforms can provide historical and future-scenario information for strategic planning and development, and real-time information for daily decision-making. These web-based platforms can additionally facilitate cooperation among GW users through a blockchain-based system for GW credit, GW trading, and GW policy incentives, as an example. Furthermore, these we-based platforms do not only inform on GW systems, but also can be useful for other smart technologies such as smart agriculture, and smart city. Insights regarding the prospects of digital GW and the anticipated transformation of GW management practices are important for researchers, GW regulators, GW managers, GW users, and technology providers to plan for tomorrow. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out to improve the quality of life of people in developed, emerging, and developing countries by covering social and economic aspects, with a focus on environmental sustainability. At the same time, data-driven technologies influence our lives in all areas and have caused fundamental economical and societal changes. This study presents a comprehensive literature review on how data-driven approaches have enabled or inhibited the successful achievement of the 17 SDGs to date. Our findings show that data-driven analytics and tools contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs, e.g., by making information more reliable, supporting better-informed decision-making, implementing data-based policies, prioritizing actions, and optimizing the allocation of resources. Based on a qualitative content analysis, results were aggregated into a conceptual framework, including the following categories: (1) uses of data-driven methods (e.g., monitoring, measurement, mapping or modeling, forecasting, risk assessment, and planning purposes), (2) resulting positive effects, (3) arising challenges, and (4) recommendations for action to overcome these challenges. Despite positive effects and versatile applications, problems such as data gaps, data biases, high energy consumption of computational resources, ethical concerns, privacy, ownership, and security issues stand in the way of achieving the 17 SDGs. © 2022 by the authors.

For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Digitalization of an enterprise is necessary to increase the efficiency and sustainability of its functioning through dramatic changes in the quality of management, both technological processes and decision-making processes at all levels of management, based on modern methods of production and further use of information about the state and prediction of possible changes in managed elements and subsystems. For the purposes of designing a digital transformation of an enterprise, it is necessary to develop a classification of digital technologies according to the criterion of accessibility and expediency of their implementation in the enterprise. Thus, key digital technologies are grouped into three groups: basic technologies are technologies without which digital transformation of an enterprise is impossible (cloud technologies, wireless technologies, paperless technologies, etc.); critical technologies are technologies that provide a complete digital transformation of the enterprise (big data, cloud computing, unmanned technologies, etc.); breakthrough technologies - technologies that realize the transition from analog to a digital enterprise (artificial intelligence, neural networks, distributed data registry, machine learning, etc.) © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

ABSTRACT: Digital technologies are considered to be an essential enabler of the circular economy in various industries. However, to date, very few studies have investigated which digital technologies could enable the circular economy in the built environment. This study specifically focuses on the built environment as one of the largest, most energy- and material-intensive industries globally, and investigates the following question: which digital technologies potentially enable a circular economy in the built environment, and in what ways? The research uses an iterative stepwise method: (1) framework development based on regenerating, narrowing, slowing and closing resource loop principles; (2) expert workshops to understand the usage of digital technologies in a circular built environment; (3) a literature and practice review to further populate the emerging framework with relevant digital technologies; and (4) the final mapping of digital technologies onto the framework. This study develops a novel Circular Digital Built Environment framework. It identifies and maps ten enabling digital technologies to facilitate a circular economy in the built environment. These include: (1) additive/robotic manufacturing, (2) artificial intelligence, (3) big data and analytics, (4) blockchain technology, (5) building information modelling, (6) digital platforms/marketplaces, (7) digital twins, (8) the geographical information system, (9) material passports/databanks, and (10) the internet of things. The framework provides a fruitful starting point for the novel research avenue at the intersection of circular economy, digital technology and the built environment, and gives practitioners inspiration for sustainable innovation in the sector. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: During the past few years, many countries have put forward their national manufacturing strategies. Although these strategies are proposed and developed under different backgrounds, their common objective is to achieve intelligent manufacturing, which has the potential to revolutionise manufacturing industry and is being nurtured through national projects such as "Industry 4.0" in Germany, "Made Smarter" in the UK, "Industrial Internet" in the US, and "Intelligent Manufacturing" in China, etc. These projects promote a new manufacturing philosophy to guide the development of industrial manufacturing in a digital, intelligent and networked global environment, as well as upgrade the traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing. With taking advantages of artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing technologies, intelligent manufacturing connects all manufacturing facilities and enables physical processes and information flows to be available when and where they are needed across holistic manufacturing supply chains, this will benefit optimizing manufacturing resources, improving product quality, system productivity and sustainability, and reducing costs. Intelligent manufacturing has attracted intense attention due to the broad application of artificial intelligence and information science technology in manufacturing industry. In this study, 1370 papers in intelligent manufacturing are taken as data sources, which are retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection Database between 1987 to 2017. The present paper aims to reveal the development status, the number of documents by leading countries, hotspots and trends of intelligent manufacturing by VOSviewer tool. Based on annual outputs and growth rate of literatures, the initial development stage (1987-1997), the stable development stage (1998-2012) and the rapid development stage (2013-2017) of intelligent manufacturing are proposed. On the whole, to date, China takes a leading position out of more than 100 countries or regions, followed by America and England. With more than 30 years of evolution, the connotation of intelligent manufacturing mainly goes through the process from digitalization to networking and then to intellectualization. In the recent research (since 2013), new enabling technologies for intelligent manufacturing have been developed, including Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Digital Twin (DT), Cloud Manufacturing, and Cyber-Physical System (CPS), which endow the manufacturing process with intelligence. For instance, IoT devices can communicate and interact with each other, and thus enable the real-time monitoring and dynamic control. Big data analytics together with AI can help to mine out potential rules, knowledge and patterns, in order to smart prediction, evaluation, optimization and decision-making. DT aims at constructing interactive virtual mirrors for physical assets and fusing both real and simulated data to give more insights. Cloud Manufacturing transforms manufacturing resources and manufacturing capabilities into manufacturing services, which can be managed and operated in an intelligent and unified way to enable the full sharing and circulating of manufacturing resources and manufacturing capabilities. These technologies can be combined with each other and greatly promote the innovation of manufacturing in design, production, operation and maintenance, etc. The findings presented in this study reveal the technical developing tendency and current hot topics in intelligent manufacturing and will facilitate scholars' investigation in the related fields, a comprehensive taxonomy of Intelligent Manufacturing can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review. © 2020, Science Press.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the relationship between digital financial inclusion, external financing, and the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises in China. The choice of corporate financing methods is an important part of organizational behavioral psychology, and different financing models will have a certain effect on organizational performance, especially in the digital economy environment. Therefore, based on resource dependence theory and financing constraint theory, the present study utilizes the panel data collected from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database from 2011 to 2020 of 112 companies in the Yangtze River Delta region and the “The Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)” released by the Peking University Digital Finance Research Center and Ant Financial Group. The results show that the Digital Financial Inclusion Index (DFIIC) has a significant positive correlation with the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises. The higher the level of debt financing, the stronger the role of digital financial inclusion in promoting innovation performance. Investigating the DFIIC in terms of coverage breadth and usage depth, we find that usage depth does not significantly encourage innovation performance. The effect of the interaction between coverage breadth and external financing is consistent with the results for the DFIIC. The study suggests that equity financing promotes the usage depth of the DFIIC in state-owned enterprises. In contrast, debt financing promotes the coverage breadth of non-state-owned enterprises. Finally, we propose relevant policy recommendations based on the research results. It includes in-depth popularization of inclusive finance in the daily operations of enterprises at the technical level, refinement of external financing policy incentives for enterprises based on the characteristics of ownership, and strengthening the research of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. The paper presents a range of theoretical and practical implications for practitioners and academics relevant to high-tech enterprises. Copyright © 2021 Han and Gu.

ABSTRACT: Technological advances such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, social media, and geographic information systems represent a building block of the digital transformation that supports the resilience of the food supply chain (FSC) and increases its efficiency. This paper reviews the literature surrounding digitalization in FSCs. A bibliometric and key-route main path analysis was carried out to objectively and analytically uncover the knowledge development in digitalization within the context of sustainable FSCs. The research began with the selection of 2140 articles published over nearly five decades. Then, the articles were examined according to several bibliometric metrics such as year of publication, countries, institutions, sources, authors, and keywords frequency. A keyword co-occurrence network was generated to cluster the relevant literature. Findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate that research at the intersection of technology and the FSC has gained substantial interest from scholars. On the basis of keyword co-occurrence network, the literature is focused on the role of information communication technology for agriculture and food security, food waste and circular economy, and the merge of the Internet of Things and blockchain in the FSC. The analysis of the key-route main path uncovers three critical periods marking the development of technology-enabled FSCs. The study offers scholars a better understanding of digitalization within the agri-food industry and the current knowledge gaps for future research. Practitioners may find the review useful to remain ahead of the latest discussions of technologyenabled FSCs. To the authors’ best knowledge, the current study is one of the few endeavors to explore technology-enabled FSCs using a comprehensive sample of journal articles published during the past five decades. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: With the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the needs of data and information sharing within cities, smart city aims to provide value-added services to improve citizens’ quality of life. But, currently city planners/developers are faced with inadequate contextual information on the dimensions of smart city required to achieve a sustainable society. Therefore, in achieving sustainable society, there is need for stakeholders to make strategic decisions on how to implement smart city initiatives. Besides, it is required to specify the smart city dimensions to be adopted in making cities smarter for sustainability attainment. But, only a few methods such as big data, internet of things, cloud computing, etc. have been employed to support smart city attainment. Thus, this study integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) as an artificial intelligence technique to develop a recommender system towards promoting smart city planning. CBR provides suggestions on smart city dimensions to be adopted by city planners/decision-makers in making cities smarter and sustainable. Accordingly, survey data were collected from 115 respondents to evaluate the applicability of the implemented CBR recommender system in relation to how the system provides best practice recommendations and retaining of smart city initiatives. Results from descriptive and exploratory factor analyses suggest that the developed system is applicable in supporting smart city adoption. Besides, findings from this study are expected to provide valuable insights for practitioners to develop more practical strategies and for researchers to better understand smart city dimensions. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With recent advances in the information revolution, Digital Twin, with its complementary technologies, especially Big Data, Internet of Thing (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), is becoming the core of novel strategies to maintain sustainability in Industry 4.0 networks and smart manufacturing. Despite the potential advantages of Digital Twin, such as virtual accessibility, remote monitoring, and timely customisation, not all sorts of enterprises have the resources or capabilities to incorporate such an advanced system, particularly Small to Medium size Enterprises (SMEs), due to their volatile nature of Supply Chains (SC). In this context, a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)-based, Agent Oriented Smart Factory (xAOSF) framework presents an over-arching SC architecture, with an associated Agent Oriented Storage and Retrieval (AOSR) based warehouse management strategy to help bridge the gap between Industry 4.0 frameworks and SME-oriented setups. This paper presents an approach towards realising the concept of Digital Twin via the xAOSF/AOSR framework, utilising state-of-the-art semantic modelling and analytical industrial tools. An amalgamation of CPS and Big Data Analytics is important to establish an effective Digital Twin to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. This paper brings attention to this critical intersection and highlights how the xAOSF/AOSR framework can be scaled to implement Digital Twin effectively, which helps in analysing the bottleneck and threshold-states in real-time, especially in manufacturing organisations, which can lead towards full autonomy in an Industry 4.0 environment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: With the proclaimed advent of Industry 4.0 in supply chains, digitalisation is expected to restructure the ways in which buying firms and suppliers in supply chains collaborate, including on sustainability issues. Digital technologies are expected to foster information exchange and facilitate collaboration on sustainability issues between firms. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence explaining the role of Industry 4.0 in the context of sustainable supply chain management. This qualitative, exploratory study examines digitalisation in the electronics supply chain and its implications for sustainable supply chain collaboration (SCC). We focus on environmental sustainability aspects, such as environmental data analysis and energy use in the supply chain. We conducted 18 interviews with representatives from international electronics buying firms and Chinese suppliers to explore a) how digital technologies are currently used in SCC, and b) which opportunities, risks, and obstacles are associated with digitalisation in sustainable SCC. Our results indicate that a broad range of digital technologies on different digital maturity levels (including Industry 4.0 technologies) are used in SCC, but their use for sustainability purposes is still underdeveloped. Digitalisation is expected by most firms to improve sustainability, e.g., using big data analytics for energy management or easing the transfer of sustainability knowledge in the chain (what we call "digital environmental upgrading"). We argue, however, that if firms do not prioritise addressing sustainability through digitalisation in collaboration, digitalisation-related sustainability potentials will either not materialise on the firm-level, e.g., due to data sharing concerns, or will tend to be overshadowed by the negative indirect effects of digitalisation, such as rebound effects. We propose three political and managerial levers to enhance the overall socio-ecological performance of the supply chain. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Green and Digital Transformation, using digital technologies for green and inclusive development, has become the main agenda for both policy-makers and researchers. European Union (EU), for instance, has targeted the twin transition towards a green and digital economy by proposing a European Green Deal, guiding its investment and planning on the industrial applications using digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud and Internet of Things. While some work has been conducted to examine the digital transformation of different industries, no systematic review has been conducted to analyze the research fronts on the topic of green and digital transformation. With the purpose to layout an overall roadmap for industries and research, a scientometric study was conducted to map out the evolution, main journals, authors and keywords, thereby providing policy and research suggestions for science and technology innovations. This scientometric report on green and digital transformation, with its core value in summarizing scientific literature data using data science and machine learning techniques, provides timely accessible visualization for policy-makers, innovators and researchers evidence-based insights to make better decisions. Future research can build upon the preliminary findings here for the methodological, information and research need for tracking the development of green and digital transformation, so as to produce better strategic foresight. © 2020 ACM.

This provides a data-driven strategy for efficiently growing and maintaining crops on cultivable land, enabling farmers to use most of the resources at their disposal. Throughout the supply chain, daily operations create massive volumes of data. Most of this information was previously untouched, but with the help of big data technologies, such information can be used to improve the performance and production of any crop. Depending on the crop type and its growth needs, digitised harvesters can help handle huge areas in various situations, particularly agriculture. This paper is brief about Agriculture 4.0 and its condition. Smart farming, Various key technologies and specific domains for the Exploring Agriculture 4.0 Domain are discussed in detail and, finally, identified and discussed significant applications of Agriculture 4.0 technologies. These technologies are essential to our lives since they simplify our daily duties without recognising them. In Agriculture 4.0 systems, fleets of digitised equipment employ current infrastructures like cloud computing to connect, identify the processing condition of different regions and the requirement for input materials and coordinate the machinery. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The energy transition-revolution paradigm is coming with a new vision of interaction models to smartly manage the energy and data exchanged between all participants in the whole power system with solid regard to sustainability, resilience, cybersecurity, and privacy. Added to the switching from fossil to renewable power sources, the demand-side management (DSM), which is a mix of software and hardware models with data analytics capabilities, is a crucial enabler of the energy transaction. More than the demand-response functionalities, the DSM includes the overall management of the grid infrastructure while minimizing consumers' discomfort and maximizing the grid stability with respect to environmental commitments. This article reviews the application of several methodologies for DSM within the context of modern power grids. Existing DSM approaches are described and categorized while offering informative discussions to help reason through all considered studies. Future research avenues are pointed by suggesting DSM improvements for the context of the global trends in data analysis/cybersecurity for liberalizing electricity markets based on energy transactions and DSM-based communities, especially for smart cities. The standardization, the regulations, the data privacy, the cybersecurity issues, and their contributions to the energy system were reviewed as open issues in the context of a modern DSM.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Fungal pathogens contribute to significant disease burden globally; however, the fact that fungi are eukaryotes has greatly complicated their role in fungal-mediated infections and alleviation. Antifungal drugs are often toxic to host cells and there is increasing evidence of adaptive resistance in animals and humans. Existing fungal diagnostic and treatment regimens have limitations that has contributed to the alarming high mortality rates and prolonged morbidity seen in immunocompromised cohorts caused by opportunistic invasive infections as evidenced during HIV and COVID-19 pandemics. There is a need to develop real-time monitoring and diagnostic methods for fungal pathogens and to create a greater awareness as to the contribution of fungal pathogens in disease causation. Greater information is required on the appropriate selection and dose of antifungal drugs including factors governing resistance where there is commensurate need to discover more appropriate and effective solutions. Popular azole fungal drugs are widely detected in surface water and sediment due to incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plants where they are resistant to microbial degradation and may cause toxic effects on aquatic organisms such as algae and fish. UV has limited effectiveness in destruction of anti-fungal drugs where there is increased interest in the combination approaches such as novel use of pulsed-plasma gas-discharge technologies for environmental waste management. There is growing interest in developing alternative and complementary green eco-biocides and disinfection innovation. Fungi present challenges for cleaning, disinfection and sterilization of reusable medical devices such as endoscopes where they (example, Aspergillus and Candida species) can be protected when harboured in build-up biofilm from lethal processing. Information on the efficacy of established disinfection and sterilization technologies to address fungal pathogens including bottleneck areas that present high risk to patients is lacking. There is a need to address risk mitigation and modelling to inform efficacy of appropriate intervention technologies that must consider all contributing factors where there is potential to adopt digital technologies to enable real-time analysis of big data, such as use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. International consensus on standardised protocols for developing and reporting on appropriate alternative eco-solutions must be reached, particularly in order to address fungi with increasing drug resistance where research and innovation can be enabled using a One Health approach. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: According to UN-Habitat, in 2020 there were 1,934 metropolises around the world, representing approximately 60 per cent of the world’s urban population. In 2020, 2.5bn people lived in metropolises, which is equivalent to one-third of the global population. Due to their structure and function, this typology of city has become central in tackling key urban challenges in recent years. Thanks to information communications technology (ICT), artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and big data analysis, they have demonstrated great flexibility in policymaking and innovation, rethinking their functions and spaces, and enhancing resilience and sustainability in order to provide better services in more efficient ways. Fifteen-minute cities, investment in algorithms for public mobility, conversion of abandoned areas into green spaces, are only some of the solutions adopted around the world in both developed and developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital processes, allowing for a reconsideration of urban environments, movement, and existence through the employment of new technologies and solutions. Therefore, the major goals of this research are to: 1) review the literature on the influence of ICTs on urban areas; 2) analyse the research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cities; and 3) analyse new policies and resolutions on urban and city planning. © Henry Stewart Publications.

ABSTRACT: Emerging sensors, computers, network technologies, and connected platforms result potentially in an immeasurable collection of data within plant operations. This creates the possibility of solving problems innovatively. Because most of the data appear to be unstructured or semi-structured, organizations shall design and adopt new strategies. Further, workflow architectures with data analytics are needed including machine learning tools and artificial intelligence techniques before proto-type solutions can be developed. We shall discuss several prospects of using (big) data analytics integrated with cloud services to produce solutions for improving plant operations. The paper outlines the vision and a systematic framework highlighting the data analytics lifecycle in the area of plant operation, process safety, and environmental protection. Four rather diverse example case studies are demonstrated including (1) deep learning-based predictive maintenance monitoring modeling, (2) Natural Language Processing (NLP) for mining text, (3) barrier assessment for dynamic risk mapping (DRA), and (4) correlation development for sustainability indicators. It further discusses the challenges in both research and implementation of proposed solutions in the industry. It is concluded that a well-balanced integrated approach including machine supporting decisions integrated with expert knowledge and available information from various key resources is required to enable more informed policy, strategic, and operational risk decision-making leading to safer, reliable and more efficient operations. © 2020

ABSTRACT: In this article a case study is carried out to investigate the role of an IT platform connecting companies in the supply chain. The significance of IT platforms is that they facilitate information, communication and new technologies and allow companies to increase efficiency and optimise their supply chain processes. The renewed version of supply chain finance conceptual model by Jansen (2018) was used to study and to analyse the case of the Heering-Holland company as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offering transport solutions for conditioned poultry transport. Heering-Holland uses the TradeCloud platform for its supply chain to connect with suppliers and customers. The authors evaluated the impact of the use of this platform on company sustainable performance in general and its financial benefits on basis of supply chain finance metrics such as improvement of liquidity, decrease in Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), increase in Return on Equity (ROE) and multiple value creation. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In manufacturing companies, especially in SMEs, the optimization of processes in terms of resource consumption, waste minimization, and pollutant emissions is becoming increasingly important. Another important driver is digitalization and the associated increase in the volume of data. These data, from a multitude of devices and systems, offer enormous potential, which increases the need for intelligent, dynamic analysis models even in smaller companies. This article presents the results of an investigation into whether and to what extent machine learning processes can contribute to optimizing energy consumption and reducing incorrectly produced plastic parts in plastic processing SMEs. For this purpose, the machine data were recorded in a plastics-producing company for the automotive industry and analyzed with regard to the material and energy flows. Machine learning methods were used to train these data in order to uncover optimization potential. Another problem that was addressed in the project was the analysis of manufacturing processes characterized by strong non-linearities and time-invariant behavior with Big Data methods and self-learning controls. Machine learning is suitable for this if sufficient training data are available. Due to the high material throughput in the production of the SMEs’ plastic parts, these requirements for the development of suitable learning methods were met. In response to the increasing importance of current information technologies in industrial production processes, the project aimed to use these technologies for sustainable digitalization in order to reduce the industry’s environmental impact and increase efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the author discusses the need to elevate sustainability to the scrutiny of the Board. Coronavirus disease-2019 and the lessons learned must nudge corporations to think and act more holistically about sustainability and incorporate sustainability into the fabric of the organisation. Each Board Committee must do its part in ensuring the company adopts a robust framework around sustainability. Equally important to reporting on sustainability issues and measuring and managing sustainability risk, is measuring and analysing a company’s sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Key Board Committees all need to understand the impact global macro systemic risks can have on the company and the impact the company can have on externalities which can affect its sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Boards need to ensure that every strategic decision is made through a sustainability lens. Not only will this enhance its societal impact but can be a key driver of performance. A strategic focus on sustainability at the Board level can be a source of competitive advantage. Boards need to measure and understand their sustainability ‘reputational footprint’ and benchmark themselves against their peers. Using big data and artificial intelligence, a corporate Board could integrate sustainability data into its business model and strategic decisions to give it a competitive advantage vs its peers. Boards need to have sufficient fluency in the latest sustainability technology to apply advanced statistical, data-driven information to optimise their sustainability ‘reputational footprint,’ which lowers their cost of capital and improves other financial metrics. © Henry Stewart Publications.

ABSTRACT: The future integration of different energy carriers in a single multi-energy network is fundamental for enhancing the flexibility, efficiency and sustainability of the whole energy system. This challenge is strongly associated with the digital transition of networks, as it requires an integrated management of data coming not only from several internal systems of utilities (GIS, asset management, DMS), but also related to different energy vectors. This paper presents a semantic, modular, open-source platform based on international standards to manage and study multi-energy networks: the Multi Energy Semantic Platform (MESP). The architecture, based on Kubernetes and microservices, ensures synergy between semantic web technologies and big data/machine learning algorithms. To show the potential of the platform, a real case study for the city of Milan is presented. In this example, the electricity distribution grid and the district heating network are described using a compatible semantic model (based on IEC CIM) and their exchange points are identified and geographically visualized. Both utilities and universities may benefit from this open-source platform, which supports an easy integration of innovative artificial intelligence algorithms and is adaptable according to the needs of considered use cases. Moreover, the MESP may support management operations of energy communities or small electric cooperatives, which cannot afford large investments both in economic terms and in human resources.  © 2022 AEIT.

ABSTRACT: To make supply chains sustainable and smart, companies can use information and communication technologies to manage procurement, sourcing, conversion, logistics, and customer relationship management activities. Characterized by profit, people, and planet, the supply chain processes of creating values and managing risks are expected to be digitally transformed. Once digitized, datafied, and networked, supply chains can account for substantial progress towards sustainability. Given the lack of clarity on the concepts of resilience and human rights for the supply chain, especially with the recent advancement of social media, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, the study conducts a scoping review. To identify the size, scope, and themes, it collected 180 articles from the Web of Science bibliographic database. The bibliometric findings reveal the overall conceptual and intellectual structure, and the gaps for further research and development. The concept of resilience can be enriched, for instance, by the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. The enriched notion of resilience can also be expressed in digitized, datafied, and networked forms.  © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Modern cities dynamically face several challenges including digitalization, sustainability, resilience and economic development. Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these challenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form's indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML applications for mitigating the challenges of modern cities planning. First and foremost, an overview of the urban forms, sources of urban data, the ML and DL techniques as well as their potential in solving the aforementioned challenges. For each ML method, we will highlight it working principle, advantages, disadvantages and potential applications using comparative tables. Finally, we will discuss the issues and challenges of ML methods in urban form's modeling while ultimately advocating some future research directions. © 2022

ABSTRACT: In recent years, the sustainable development of education has become an increasing concern, and new technology characterized by intelligence has played an important role in promoting it. However, facing the endless stream of teaching platforms, learning platforms, student management platforms and learning APPs, teachers and students are tired of coping. Meanwhile, there has been a serious lack of real information about student growth, especially in the fields of electronic graphics, and audio and video materials. At present, there is no continuous student growth system that can be used over the course of their life, which is very unfavorable to their individual development. Graphic code is a technology with the potential to solve these problems; however, the existing graphic code technology suffers from clear deficiencies in the realization of a personalized student growth system that incorporates intelligence, security and sustainability. In response to this, this paper proposes a new generation of graphic code technology, namely intelligent graph element technology (IGET). Further, a new sustainable personalized student growth system model is designed based on artificial intelligence, big data analysis and intelligent graph element technologies, and the architecture and implementation of this system platform are completed. Finally, a student growth system based on intelligent code is verified through by an analysis of the results of a questionnaire survey. The research results show that, compared with the traditional student management system, the student growth system based on an intelligent graph element code has obvious advantages in convenience, intelligence, precision, security, and sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Real estate needs to improve its adoption of disruptive technologies to move from traditional to smart real estate (SRE). This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology's practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders-consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries-and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers' needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers' needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets. The study, being the first to explore real estate technologies, is limited by the number of research publications on the SRE technologies that has been compensated through incorporation of online reports. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Given the impacts of information and communications technologies on the planet and people, researchers from all disciplines need to pay attention to the environmental footprints and sustainable opportunities associated with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data applications. In order to provide a preliminary discussion on the eco-design of AI and Big Data applications, the paper aims to map out the sources and topics to explore (1) the intersections of eco-design with AI and Big Data, and (2) the sustainable and eco-friendly design. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 236 articles gathered from the Web of Science (WoS) database, the paper has identified main research topics, publication outlets, research fronts, and intellectual bases and explored their inter-relationship and grouping. The leading application disciplines include construction & building technology, automation & control system, computer & information science, and business & economics. Multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary journals such as Sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Cities and Society have been proven to be more receptive to such eco-design research outputs. As the notion of eco-design of AI and Big Data applications is expected to be pertinent and relevant for designing greener strategies, products and services for green digital transformation, we argue that more concerted efforts must be made to advance both the theoretical and empirical research on the nascent topic among researchers, funding bodies, policy-makers and industry professionals. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Air pollution is a global geo-hazard with significant implications, including deterioration of health and premature death. Climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity impact air pollution by affecting the strength, transportation, and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Emerging data science tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) big data analytics, are being utilized to predict air pollution intensity and frequency under varying climatic conditions for effective mitigation plans. However, comprehensive documentation of these digitalization approaches and outcomes in terms of correlating future air pollution with climate change remains scant. This study addresses this gap by systematically reviewing pertinent literature on climate change and air pollution studies. We also investigated the potentials of integrated spatial data science for spatial modelling and identifying cities vulnerable to air pollution hazards. Our findings show that climatic factors and seasonal variations are critical predictors of air quality in urban areas. A strong correlation exists between climate change and air quality, and air quality in urbanized regions is projected to deteriorate with climate change in the future. Therefore, climatic variables remain essential factors for the prediction of air quality. Also, air pollutants tend to have higher concentration in the warm season, making the consideration of seasonal changes crucial in air quality management. The study also revealed that machine learning algorithms such as random forest, gradient boosting machine, and classification and regression trees (CART) accurately predict air pollution hazard when integrated with spatial models. The detailed review of literature undertaken in this study provides a strong basis for the conclusion that the integration of spatial techniques and machine learning has the potential to improve air pollution prediction outcome and aid appropriate intervention initiatives by the stakeholders. Thus, emerging geospatial intelligence technologies and digital innovations particularly Artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data analytics that underpin the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) can enhance existing early warning mechanisms and support a prompt and effective response to climate-change-induced air pollution, thereby fostering sustainable cities and societies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Digitalization is playing an important role in the emerging practice of Building-to-Grid (B2G). However, the majority of the literature only covers either the grid side, the demand side, or the technical aspect of B2G integration, and an overview of the digitalization in B2G and the involved stakeholders is missing. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a definition of the B2G ecosystem and provides an overview of the digitalization of the B2G ecosystem with six aspects (B2G goals and themes, B2G technologies, B2G data sources and data management, and B2G related stakeholders). This paper also discusses five emerging technologies (5G, IoT, big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain) and three main challenges of the applications of the emerging technologies in the B2G ecosystem (Security and privacy, interoperability and scalability, coordination, and dysfunctional emerging behaviors of collective intelligent controls). Lastly, this paper recommends future research directions in the Building-to-Grid ecosystem (especially ecosystem modeling and simulation), B2G’s role in smart cities, sustainability, resilience, and harmonization of the B2G ecosystem, and other emerging technologies in B2G. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Today's globalized and highly competitive world market has broadened the spectrum of requirements in all the sectors of the agri-food industry. This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Currently, sustainability is a vital aspect for every nation and organization to accomplish Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics are used to evaluate the sustainability level of an organization. According to the statistics, 53% of respondents in the BlackRock survey are concerned about the availability of low ESG data, which is critical for determining the organization’s sustainability level. This obstacle can be overcome by implementing Industry 4.0 technologies, which enable real-time data, data authentication, prediction, transparency, authentication, and structured data. Based on the review of previous studies, it was determined that only a few studies discussed the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for ESG data and evaluation. The objective of the study is to discuss the significance of ESG data and report, which is used for the evaluation of the sustainability of an organization. In this regard, the assimilation of Industry 4.0 technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data for obtaining ESG data by an organization is detailed presented to study the progress of advancement of these technologies for ESG. On the basis of analysis, this study concludes that consumers are concerned about the ESG data, as most organizations develop inaccurate ESG data and suggest that these digital technologies have a crucial role in framing an accurate ESG report. After analysis a few vital conclusions are drawn such as ESG investment has benefited from AI capabilities, which previously relied on self-disclosed, annualized company information that was susceptible to inherent data issues and biases. Finally, the article discusses the vital recommendations that can be implemented for future work. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This chapter explores how major technological developments in big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are shaping the global shift towards sustainable investment. It explains how finance is now experiencing an “x-ray moment”, with technologies such as AI and machine learning allowing us to assess vast, complex data sets and look beneath the surface of companies. Further, the chapter explores what this explosive growth of non-financial information means for both investors and corporates, and why there are still challenges that stand in the way of truly mainstreaming corporate sustainability data. The different sections look at how we are currently witnessing a move from shareholder to stakeholder capitalism, as companies’ behaviour is increasingly evaluated on a broader stakeholder agenda. How will this drive towards “conscious capitalism” push companies to become better corporate citizens, and what role will technology play in the future of sustainable finance?. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Herman Bril, Georg Kell and Andreas Rasche.

ABSTRACT: Advancements in Cloud-native services, Machine-Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Rapid Application Development (RAD) using the Agile methodology has led countless industries to achieving desirable levels of automation while reducing cost and improving quality software deployments, timely / iterative delivery, and accountability. Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts - in terms of new capabilities - in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today's systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.  © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Since the last decade, most of our daily activities have become digital. Digital health takes into account the ever-increasing synergy between advanced medical technologies, innovation, and digital communication. Thanks to machine learning, we are not limited anymore to a descriptive analysis of the data, as we can obtain greater value by identifying and predicting patterns resulting from inductive reasoning. Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for “what-if” models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability. In this context, new digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are certainly a great opportunity. Herein, we report the results of a careful analysis of the current literature and represent the vision of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD) on this controversial topic that, if well used, may be the key for a great scientific innovation. AMD believes that the use of artificial intelligence will enable the conversion of data (descriptive) into knowledge of the factors that “affect” the behavior and correlations (predictive), thereby identifying the key aspects that may establish an improvement of the expected results (prescriptive). Artificial intelligence can therefore become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine. This, in turn, will allow for comprehensive therapies to be built in accordance with the evidence criteria that should always be the ground for any therapeutic choice. © Nicoletta Musacchio, Annalisa Giancaterini, Giacomo Guaita, Alessandro Ozzello, Maria A Pellegrini, Paola Ponzani, Giuseppina T Russo, Rita Zilich, Alberto de Micheli.

ABSTRACT: Researchers expect a high quality of biospecimens/data and value-added services from biobanks. Therefore, the concept of "biobank 3.0"was introduced so that biobanks could better meet the needs of stakeholders and maintain sustainable operations. Theoretically, the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) has already gone through the concepts of biobank 1.0 and 2.0. However, three challenges still need to be addressed before it can be transformed into a new generation of the TWB (namely, the TWB 3.0): (1) the difficulty of integrating other biobanks' resources, (2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the release and use of biospecimens/data, and (3) the development of income and revenue models of sustainability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the TWB 3.0 transformation based on a dual-pillar approach composed of a "physically"vertical integration driven by the TWB and a "virtually"horizontal network led by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan. Using prominent biobanks such as the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC), the UK Biobank, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s All of Us Research Program as models, the TWB can strengthen its on-going TWB 2.0 operations in regional and/or international collaboration, increase the value of data collected and develop closer relationships with biobank participants and users. To these ends, the authors highlight key issues that include, but are not limited to, the harmonization of relevant ELSI standards for various biobanks' integrations; the value-added services and the efficiency of Big Data Era related research and/or precision medicine development, and financial concerns related to biobank sustainability. This paper concludes by discussing how greater participant engagement and the uptake of Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can be used in partnership with vertical and horizontal integration as part of a four-pronged approach to promote biobank sustainability, and facilitate the TWB 3.0 transformation.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Some companies improve their production performance using manufacturing or operations models. In the last decade these models have come to be known as "X" production systems (XPS), or company-specific production systems. XPS systems have been oriented mainly to implement lean manufacturing and continuous improvement principles, but have shown little progress in terms of sustainability principles. The emergence of databases (DBs), big data, and business intelligence (BI) systems have enabled the creation of system panels to measure performance and manage business processes. These panels also allow assessment of the implementation of the principles, methods, and tools of the XPS. The effectiveness of these systems requires sufficient IT infrastructure and an acceptable quality of data, but the key performance indicator (KPI) panels of XPSs often lack consistent and acceptable data. In other cases, the IT infrastructure does not cover the needs of the personnel managing the operations, which limits the progress of XPSs. This paper documents the positive experience of one company in jointly auditing and improving data quality and IT infrastructure, which better aligned its XPS with sustainability objectives. It explores, using an empirical case study where the researchers were actively involved, the possibility of complementing the KPI panel system of XPS assessment systems with the principles of sustainability, data quality, and IT infrastructure. The paper describes the development and testing of an assessment tool based on those principles, and offers a number of results that may benefit similar small- and medium-sized companies (SMEs). © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The circular economy (CE) has the potential to capitalise upon emerging digital technologies, such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and the Internet of things (IoT), amongst others. These digital technologies combined with business model innovation are deemed to provide solutions to myriad problems in the world, including those related to circular economy transformation. Given the societal and practical importance of CE and digitalisation, last decade has witnessed a significant increase in academic publication on these topics. Therefore, this study aims to capture the essence of the scholarly work at the intersection of the CE and digital technologies. A detailed analysis of the literature based on emerging themes was conducted with a focus on illuminating the path of CE implementation. The results reveal that IoT and AI play a key role in the transition towards the CE. A multitude of studies focus on barriers to digitalisation-led CE transition and highlight policy-related issues, the lack of predictability, psychological issues and information vulnerability as some important barriers. In addition, product-service system (PSS) has been acknowledged as an important business model innovation for achieving the digitalisation enabled CE. Through a detailed assessment of the existing literature, a viable systems-based framework for digitalisation enabled CE has been developed which show the literature linkages amongst the emerging research streams and provide novel insights regarding the realisation of CE benefits. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Digitalization is a key enabling factor of the dramatic transformation of metal industry since the 90-ies. Important applications were implemented since then, exploiting multi-physical modelling, complex real time process control and Machine Learning. This trend was further enhanced and accelerated by Industry 4.0. Digitalization implies harvesting impressive volumes of heterogeneous data, which need to be stored, processed and, mostly, interpreted to extract relevant information and "knowledge". Knowledge means capability of interpreting data, of explaining and representing material transformation and product evolution during the different process stages considering complex interactions among process and product variables, including aspects still not perfectly understood. Artificial Intelligence supports knowledge extraction by enabling optimal process management and control, higher flexibility and product quality, stronger resource and energy efficiency, namely sustainability. Challenges and opportunities of enhancing metallurgical science and technology through Artificial intelligence are considered in this review. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Physical Internet (PI, or pi ) paradigm has been developed for a global logistics system that aims to move, handle, store, and transport logistics products in a sustainable and efficient way. To achieve this goal, the PI requires a higher level of interconnectivity and interoperability in terms of physical, informational, and operational aspects, which, by following the principle of the digital Internet (DI), is enabled by an interconnected network of intermodal hubs, collaborative protocols, and standardized, modular, and smart containers. Meanwhile, digital transformation (DT) has become mainstream in Industry 4.0 to innovate many industries, including logistics and supply chains, through the use of breakthrough digital technologies in the fields of information, communication, connectivity, analytics, and computing, such as the next generation of communication and networking (i.e., 5G), the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data analytics (BDA), and cloud computing (CC). In this context, the introduction of DT in the PI vision has many implications for the development and realization of an efficient and sustainable global logistics system. This study investigated the perspectives of PI under the impact of DT. The major challenges and associated open research regarding the adoption of DT in PI have been thoroughly investigated.  © 2013 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The e-Governance always mean Good Governance which is the delivery of services at the citizens’ end. The cost of the service is also minimum. To strengthen the service deliveries, the government needs to emphasize the Information and Communication Technology(ICT) and make best use of it. Now, the automation or process conversion from manual to computerized system is not only the objective. The use of Machine Learning, Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence are also to be applied on e-Governance to increase the throughput. Big Data and its analysis is also used for analyzing the services, their impacts on the society and sustainability of the services for the socio-economic development of the nation. Decision-making for provisioning G2G, G2B and G2C services would be accurate with these analytics. So, Data Analytics is an important stream of Computer Science to provide better governance to the society. The Land Records System of Odisha and the e-Governance initiatives taken in that area are studied in this paper. The eMutation, which is the online updation of Record of Rights (RoR) is thoroughly analyzed and the improvement of service delivery using ICT is discussed. The analysis indicates that, how e-Governance service is more effective with Data Analytics and it provides many performance indicators to the government for taking right decisions at the right time. The Dash Board, Websites and MIS reports are designed and displayed in such a manner that becomes more effective and responsive to the need of the citizens and the society. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Innovations in Machine Learning and Data Analytics can possibly affect numerous aspects of Environmental Science (ES). Data Analytics refers to a collection of data resources indicated in terms of variety, velocity, veracity and volume. Big data contributes to the ES arena in applications such as weather forecasting, energy sustainability and disaster management with the advent of techniques such as Remote Sensing, Information and Communication technologies. Though big data is used to accomplish data analysis and interpretation for ES, there are still requirements for efficient ways of data storage, processing and retrieval. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are the sub fields of artificial intelligence which deals with training the models to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. When Machine Learning and Deep Learning are combined together it is possible to unleash the supremacy of data analytics. These techniques show high prospective for process optimization, information-centric decision making and scientific discovery. Scientific developments like these will assist ES to make real time autonomous decisions by extracting useful insights from huge data. These advancements also aid in bridging the gap between the theoretical backgrounds on ES to practical implementation. The primary objective of this survey is to figure out the basic concepts of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics and find the state-of-the-art applications in ES, and observe the impending benefits of information-centric investigation on ES. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Achieving transition towards sustainable and resilient food systems is a critical issue on the current societal agenda. This study examined the potential contribution of digitalization of the food system to such transition by reviewing 76 relevant journal articles, indexed on the Scopus database, using the integrative literature review approach and descriptive content analysis with MAXQDA 2020 software. ‘Blockchain’ was the top hit among keywords and main concepts applied to the food system. The UK as a country and Europe as a continent were found to lead the scientific research on food system digitalization. Use of digital technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things, big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and related information and communications technologies were identified as enablers. Traceability, sustainability, resilience to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing food waste were among the key benefit areas associated with digitalization for different food commodities. Challenges to practical applications related to infrastructure and cost, knowledge and skill, law and regulations, the nature of the technologies, and the nature of the food system were identified. Developing policies and regulations, supporting infrastructure development, and educating and training people could facilitate fuller digitalization of the food system. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: One essential component of any manufacturing industry's success is a successful supply chain. Customer expectations have increased due to the quick growth of information and communication technologies, which has also made the world more competitive. Global production and manufacturing have now transitioned to Industry 4.0. The "Internet of Things,""Big Data,"and "Artificial Intelligence"are the dominant digital technologies in this. Consequently, in the near future, supply chain management (SCM) will manage not only the flow of raw materials, semi-finished goods, finished goods, and services from the manufacturer to the customer, but also the flow of the most recent data for current and future supply chain visibility & sustainability. For this many companies around the world have tapped one of the advanced technique - Machin Learning (ML) for early risk identification & management, material planning & forecasting, raw material price forecasting etc. As a result, purpose of this paper is to explain a conceptual framework which illuminates factors influencing integration of Machin learning (ML) in Agile Supply chain management, its benefits, and challenges to implement.  © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Efficient decision making based on business intelligence (BI) is essential to ensure competitiveness for sustainable growth. The rapid development of information and communication technology has made collection and analysis of big data essential, resulting in a considerable increase in academic studies on big data and big data analysis (BDA). However, many of these studies are not linked to BI, as companies do not understand and utilize the concepts in an integrated way. Therefore, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, we review the literature on BI, big data, and BDA to show that they are not separate methods but an integrated decision support system. Second, we explore how businesses use big data and BDA practically in conjunction with BI through a case study of sorting and logistics processing of a typical courier enterprise. We focus on the company's cost efficiency as regards to data collection, data analysis/simulation, and the results from actual application. Our findings may enable companies to achieve management efficiency by utilizing big data through efficient BI without investing in additional infrastructure. It could also give them indirect experience, thereby reducing trial and error in order to maintain or increase competitiveness. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Modern agriculture and food production systems are facing increasing pressures from climate change, land and water availability, and, more recently, a pandemic. These factors are threatening the environmental and economic sustainability of current and future food supply systems. Scientific and technological innovations are needed more than ever to secure enough food for a fast-growing global population. Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently. Thanks to recent advances in remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can now quantify field scale phenotypic information accurately and integrate the big data into predictive and prescriptive management tools. This review focuses on the use of recent technological advances in remote sensing and AI to improve the resilience of agricultural systems, and we will present a unique opportunity for the development of prescriptive tools needed to address the next decade's agricultural and human nutrition challenges. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Climate change, excessive exploitation of resources, pollution of air and drinking water are just some of the consequences of past societal developments that must be dealt with now and in the future. Identification of new rationales, frameworks and methods in support of sustainable and resilient governance and management of the built environment is more urgent than ever. To meet the challenges of the future, and to ensure continued improvement of global welfare, past best practices must be critically assessed and disruptive changes, by means of organization and technology, must be identified and implemented. In this contribution, starting point is taken in an outline of the critical role of the built environment, in the quest for a sustainable and resilient societal developments. Thereafter, a critical inventory is presented with respect to organizational, procedural and technological - and not least regulatory factors which might be associated with past and present best practices in the governance and management of the built environment. With this basis, potentials for radical improvements in current best practices - a paradigm shift in governance and management of the built environment - through utilization of new and emerging technologies, such as cyber-physical systems, Big Data techniques and Artificial Intelligence, are presented and discussed. To illustrate the ideas and concepts addressed in the presentation, principal examples are provided addressing integrity management of structural and infrastructure systems. © 2021 IABSE Conference, Seoul 2020: Risk Intelligence of Infrastructures - Report.

ABSTRACT: Culture and natural history are facet of life that reflect the characteristics of a country. Preservation and utilization of cultural wealth and natural history are very strategic for the sustainability of a nation. Until now, various problems and challenges have arisen, such as: The widespread distribution of information, the absence of a centralized database to accommodate the existing information, the difficulty of knowing the diversity of cultural and natural history in each region, culture and natural history has not been used as elements to build the nation's character, and the current cultural and natural history information has not been used for tourism development. The cultural wealth of the Indonesian people may be eroded and slowly become extinct, or other nations will claim that this is their cultural wealth. Although conservation efforts have been carried out by various museums, national and regional libraries, and groups of activists to preserve cultural wealth, there are still many limitations to integrating and linking them to one another. Therefore, this preservation requires a digital 4.0 technology framework to be able to integrate and at the same time take advantage of this cultural and natural wealth for the welfare of the Indonesian nation. The digital technology 4.0 framework for preserving the Indonesian nation's cultural and natural wealth will be developed using a Big Data approach from various data sources (data from various museums, documentation, publications, etc.) structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Feature selection and feature extraction from Big Data will be carried out using Principle Components Analysis, Cluster Analysis. The feature extraction result is then used as the forerunner of the framework's components. The components of this framework form the basis for designing an integrated system for the preservation of cultural and natural history, and form the basis for developing and implementing a portfolio of applications using artificial intelligence, which is also the outcome of this research.  © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Crop production varies spatially and temporally within the field boundaries depending on soil and environmental conditions. The major concern of variability for agronomic inputs addresses how best to intervene in the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity to improve the potential yield of crops and feedstock. This book addresses the important question of how large a role bioproduction and renewable energy can play in achieving sustainable agricultural practices in the present system of agricultural production. Agronomy is local, which brings the challenges to the remote optimization of agricultural machinery operations for seeding, fertilizing, crop protecting, and harvesting in the field level to adopt precise agriculture technologies. Cloud computing and big data analytics bring the potential about in machine optimization and agronomy to enable the site-specific management. Understanding bioproduction engineering and development can help improve the efficiency of a sustainable agriculture system. With the aim of understanding this process, this book focuses on bioproduction and sustainability issues, covering sensors, agricultural decision-making systems and the relationship between bioproduction and sustainable practices of agriculture. The chapters are organized as follows: information oriented technology that can be implemented to address the variability of bioproduction systems, sensors and control systems, precision agricultural technology, decision support systems in agriculture, renewable energy resources and analytical hierarchy processes for agricultural management. The crop growth monitoring parameters like LAI and NDVI points were clarified in the pre-processing stage of images. The decisions and logistics that influence the market prices of agricultural products is emphasized within the revised edition of this book. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recent technological advances in the power generation and information technologies areas are helping to change the modern electricity supply system in order to comply with higher energy efficiency and sustainability standards. Smart grids are an emerging trend that introduce intelligence in the power grid to optimize resource usage. In order for this intelligence to be effective, it is necessary to retrieve enough information about the grid operation together with other context data such as environmental variables, and intelligently modify the behavior of the network elements accordingly. This article presents a multi-agent system model for virtual power plants, a new power plant concept in which generation no longer occurs in big installations, but is the result of the cooperation of smaller and more intelligent elements. The proposed model is not only focused on the management of the different elements, but includes a set of agents embedded with artificial neural networks for collaborative forecasting of disaggregated energy demand of domestic end users, the results of which are also shown in this article. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Smart product-service systems (Smart PSS) is an emerging IT-driven value proposition paradigm to depict today’s companies’ emphasis towards servitization. In technical aspect, the rapid development of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques trigger the introduction of a tremendous number of smart, connected products (SCPs). They serve as the media and tools for various e-services generation in a smart environment. Meanwhile, in business aspect, it has a vision of shared value as an eco-system with sustainability concerns. Despite few existing works discussing about its concepts, scarcely any report has been given on an effective IT infrastructure or design innovation mechanism to realize such paradigm. Aiming to fill this gap, this work proposes a hybrid crowdsensing approach with a four-layered cloud-edge computing framework for design innovation in the Smart PSS context. By leveraging the cloud-edge computing technique, data stream can be processed locally for value delivery at the edge nodes with less latency. Meanwhile, big data analytics with less temporal urgency from multiple edge nodes can be conducted in the cloud layer instead. Furthermore, due to the unique characteristics of Smart PSS, both human intelligence from online data sources (e.g. crowdsourcing) and machine intelligence from offline data sources (e.g. built-in-sensors) should be considered integrally for its design innovation. Hence, a hybrid crowd sensing approach combining both mobile crowdsensing (MCS) and static sensing mechanisms is further introduced. It is hoped this research can offer manufacturers/service providers with useful insights and better understandings in their value creation process. © 2018, Curran Associates Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The core of the digital transition is the representation of all kinds of real-world entities and processes and an increasing number of cognitive processes by digital information and algorithms on computers. These allow for seemingly unlimited storage, operation, retrieval, and transmission capacities that make digital tools economically available for all domains of society and empower human action, particularly combined with real-world interfaces such as displays, robots, sensors, 3D printers, etc. Digital technologies are general-purpose technologies providing unprecedented potential benefits for sustainability. However, they will bring about a multitude of potential unintended side effects, and this demands a transdisciplinary discussion on unwanted societal changes as well as a shift in science from analog to digital modeling and structure. Although social discourse has begun, the topical scope and regional coverage have been limited. Here, we report on an expert roundtable on digital transition held in February 2017 in Tokyo, Japan. Drawing on a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, our discussions highlight the importance of cultural contexts and the need to bridge local and global conversations. Although Japanese experts did mention side effects, their focus was on how to ensure that AI and robots could coexist with humans. Such a perspective is not well appreciated everywhere outside Japan. Stakeholder dialogues have already begun in Japan, but greater efforts are needed to engage a broader collection of experts in addition to stakeholders to broaden the social debate. © 2017 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Co-creation of scientific knowledge based on new technologies and big data sources is one of the main challenges for the digital society in the XXI century. Data management and the analysis of patterns among datasets based on machine learning and artificial intelligence has become essential for many sectors nowadays. The development of real time health-related climate services represents an example where abundant structured and unstructured information and transdisciplinary research are needed. The study of the interactions between atmospheric processes and human health through a big data approach can reveal the hidden value of data. The Oxyalert technological platform is presented as an example of a digital biometeorological infrastructure able to forecast, at an individual level, oxygen changes impacts on human health. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

ABSTRACT: Small, Micro and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMMEs) are slow to adopt Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to assist in day to day business operations. In South Africa, this is a major concern for business operating in rural areas because of great influence SMMEs have in the growth of economy and greater contribution to overall gross domestic product (GDP). This research focused on unlocking the potential of Information and Communication Technologies on (SMMEs) towards improving their operations and survival in today's dynamic modern business environment. In addition, the impact on growth and success of SMMEs through implementation of ICT was another area of concern. 138 SMMES were surveyed in the rural municipal area of Thulamela in Vhembe District, Limpopo. Data was collected from the SMMEs in Sibasa, Thohoyandou, Shayandima and Tshififi towns. Results show that SMMEs' major setbacks include lack of infrastructure, inadequate resources and limited access to finance for funding the implementation and maintenance of information systems in their operations. Inadequate technological infrastructure, transport and the basic electricity which SMMEs deemed to be important for the implementation of sound ICT utilization were identified as challenges. Despite the challenges, most SMMEs indicated that they do make use of ICT tools in their day to day operations and have a greater role in the long term operations of a business against the changing technological environment. © 2016.

ABSTRACT: Metallurgy is a key enabler of a circular economy (CE), its digitalization is the metallurgical Internet of Things (m-IoT). In short: Metallurgy is at the heart of a CE, as metals all have strong intrinsic recycling potentials. Process metallurgy, as a key enabler for a CE, will help much to deliver its goals. The first-principles models of process engineering help quantify the resource efficiency (RE) of the CE system, connecting all stakeholders via digitalization. This provides well-argued and first-principles environmental information to empower a tax paying consumer society, policy, legislators, and environmentalists. It provides the details of capital expenditure and operational expenditure estimates. Through this path, the opportunities and limits of a CE, recycling, and its technology can be estimated. The true boundaries of sustainability can be determined in addition to the techno-economic evaluation of RE. The integration of metallurgical reactor technology and systems digitally, not only on one site but linking different sites globally via hardware, is the basis for describing CE systems as dynamic feedback control loops, i.e., the m-IoT. It is the linkage of the global carrier metallurgical processing system infrastructure that maximizes the recovery of all minor and technology elements in its associated refining metallurgical infrastructure. This will be illustrated through the following: (1) System optimization models for multimetal metallurgical processing. These map large-scale m-IoT systems linked to computer-aided design tools of the original equipment manufacturers and then establish a recycling index through the quantification of RE. (2) Reactor optimization and industrial system solutions to realize the “CE (within a) Corporation—CEC,” realizing the CE of society. (3) Real-time measurement of ore and scrap properties in intelligent plant structures, linked to the modeling, simulation, and optimization of industrial extractive process metallurgical reactors and plants for both primary and secondary materials processing. (4) Big-data analysis and process control of industrial metallurgical systems, processes, and reactors by the application of, among others, artificial intelligence techniques and computer-aided engineering. (5) Minerals processing and process metallurgical theory, technology, simulation, and analytical tools, which are all key enablers of the CE. (6) Visualizing the results of all the tools used for estimating the RE of the CE system in a form that the consumer and general public can understand. (7) The smart integration of tools and methods that quantify RE and deliver sustainable solutions, named in this article as circular economy engineering. In view of space limitations, this message will be colored in by various publications also with students and colleagues, referring to (often commercial) software that acts as a conduit to capture and formalize the research of the large body of work in the literature by distinguished metallurgical engineers and researchers and realized in innovative industrial solutions. The author stands humbly on the shoulders of these developments and their distinguished developers. This award lecture article implicitly also refers to work done while working for Ausmelt (Australia), Outotec (Finland and Australia), Mintek (South Africa), and Anglo American Corporation (South Africa), honoring the many colleagues the author has worked with over the years. © 2016, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.

ABSTRACT: Natural Resources businesses span one or more of the following verticals: Explore & Discover, Develop, Extract & Transport, Market & Trade. Natural Gas (NG) is a key component of the Natural Resources industry, which contributes both directly and indirectly to sustain and support the day to day energy needs of humans. Various forums drive key initiatives to maintain the sustainability of natural resources for decades to come. The recent evolution of advanced Information Technology (IT) fields, termed as 'Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (BD&AI),' fortify these initiatives by providing anytime, anywhere access of data (for example in remote offshore assets or facilities) from a vast corpus base, in addition to enabling natural human interaction. In this paper we intend to explore the key primitives of BD&AI and cite the method of real-world implementation in the Natural Gas industry to further enable sustainable development. © 2016 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: To promote sustainable development, the smart city implies a global vision that merges artificial intelligence, big data, decision making, information and communication technology (ICT), and the internet-of-things (IoT). The ageing issue is an aspect that researchers, companies and government should devote efforts in developing smart healthcare innovative technology and applications. In this paper, the topic of disease diagnosis in smart healthcare is reviewed. Typical emerging optimization algorithms and machine learning algorithms are summarized. Evolutionary optimization, stochastic optimization and combinatorial optimization are covered. Owning to the fact that there are plenty of applications in healthcare, four applications in the field of diseases diagnosis (which also list in the top 10 causes of global death in 2015), namely cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and tuberculosis, are considered. In addition, challenges in the deployment of disease diagnosis in healthcare have been discussed. © 2017 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Emerging smart buildings, such as the NASA Sustainability Base (SB), have a broad range of energy-related systems, including systems for heating and cooling. While the innovative technologies found in SB and similar smart buildings have the potential to increase the usage of renewable energy, they also add substantial technical complexity. Consequently, managing a smart building can be a challenge compared to managing a traditional building, sometimes leading to adverse events including unintended thermal discomfort of occupants (too hot or too cold). Fortunately, todays smart buildings are typically equipped with thousands of sensors, controlled by Building Automation Systems (BASs). However, manually monitoring a BAS time series data stream with thousands of values may lead to information overload for the people managing a smart building. We present here a novel technique, Scalable Causal Learning (SCL), that integrates dimensionality reduction and Bayesian network structure learning techniques. SCL solves two problems associated with the naive application of dimensionality reduction and causal machine learning techniques to BAS time series data: (i) using autoregressive methods for causal learning can lead to induction of spurious causes and (ii) inducing a causal graph from BAS sensor data using existing graph structure learning algorithms may not scale to large data sets. Our novel SCL method addresses both of these problems. We test SCL using time series data from the SB BAS, comparing it with a causal graph learning technique, the PC algorithm. The causal variables identified by SCL are effective in predicting adverse events, namely abnormally low room temperatures, in a conference room in SB. Specifically, the SCL method performs better than the PC algorithm in terms of false alarm rate, missed detection rate and detection time.
