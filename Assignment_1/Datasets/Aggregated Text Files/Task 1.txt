We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality
Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at
where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other
augmented reality stocks.

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our
perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through
devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various
ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic

Similarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold,
with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through
growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related
companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding
total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the
peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite
the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the
largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of
augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January.
Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-
reality glasses maker that positions itself as a more affordable
alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in
January at a $1 billion valuation.

Most notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality
startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the
tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a
space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search
engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked
during a 2012 demo where skvdivers used the glasses to live

Adobe Systems (ADBE) has experienced a significant increase in its share
price, with shares rising 31% over the past three months. This surge
followed a strong quarterly earnings report released in June, which
underscored the robust demand for the company's artificial intelligence-
related products. J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy has set a price target of
$580 for Adobe, suggesting a potential 1% increase from its current levels.
Murphy also mentioned that a new suite of Al applications, including the
generative machine learning model Firefly, could potentially push shares
higher throughout the remainder of 2024.

Adobe's earnings are projected to grow by 13% for the current fiscal year.
There has been a revision in the earnings estimate upwards for fiscal 2024
by one analyst.

The next earnings release of Adobe Systems is anticipated on September
12, 2024. Analysts predict Adobe Systems will post earnings of $4.53 per
share, marking a year-over-year growth of 10.76%. The current consensus
estimate forecasts the revenue to be $5.37 billion, indicating a 9.72%
growth compared to the same quarter of the previous year. For the entire
year, earnings of $18.16 per share and revenue of $21.45 billion are

Accenture and Adobe to Co-Develop Industry-Specific Generative Al Solutions to Accelerate
Marketing Transformation

Collaboration will help organizations move from generative Al experimentation to adoption at scale

LAS VEGAS; Mar. 25, 2024 - Through a strategic expansion of its relationship of more than 20 years,
Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has been selected by Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) to co-develop industry-specific
solutions using Adobe Firefly, Adobe's family of creative generative Al models, to help organizations
create personalized content at scale and accelerate the transformation of their content supply chains.

Accenture will integrate Adobe Firefly Custom Models into marketing services offered by Accenture
Song, to provide clients with the industry-specific insights required to train bespoke models on their
proprietary data and brand guidelines. Firefly, which is designed to be safe for commercial use, is also
accessible via APIs through Firefly Services, as well as through Adobe Creative Cloud and Experience
Cloud applications. By generating content that aligns with their brand style and design language,
marketers can build templatized campaigns that can be continually refined based on performance data
and impact. This iterative approach streamlines the content creation process and reduces the need for
manual adjustments.

With an initial focus on the retail and consumer goods, automotive, financial services and health
industries, the new solutions will leverage Accenture’s extensive data and Al engineering capabilities
and systematic approach to responsible Al, coupled with its approach to driving unified brand
experiences. By integrating the solutions with Adobe's broader suite of generative Al-powered solutions
and client systems, organizations can realize value faster with content that is globally consistent, locally
relevant and industry specific. Additionally, Accenture engineers will be trained to be specialists in

OpenAl, Microsoft, and Adobe Back
California’s Al Watermarking Bill

Written By
Published August 28,2024 | & Fiona Jackson

The three tech giants have reportedly penned letters of support to California
lawmakers.

OpenAl, Microsoft, and Adobe are publicly supporting the AB-3211 bill that would require tech companies to label Al-
generated content in California.

Watermarks must be added to the metadata of photos, videos, and audio recordings that were produced or significantly
modified by generative Al systems, according to the legislation.

The bill will also require large social media platforms, such as X and Instagram, to apply “easy-to-understand” labels to
uploaded content that users can click to view. Visual labels should be applied to audio clips and music videos.

How do you know if an artificial intelligence system is so powerful that it poses a
security danger and shouldn’t be unleashed without careful oversight? For
regulators trying to put guardrails on Al, it’s mostly about the arithmetic.
Specifically, an AI model trained on 10 to the 26th floating-point operations per
second must now be reported to the US government and could soon trigger even
stricter requirements in California.
